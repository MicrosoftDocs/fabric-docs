Yeah that is odd.  If you look at the history, the post-import.yml file, which doesn't have the changes live, is showing it was updated 2 days ago.
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/powerbi-rest-api-docs-pr/commits/main/docs-ref-autogen/power-bi/Imports/Post-Import.yml

But the post-import-in-group.yml, which has the change live, is showing it was not updated since March.
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/powerbi-rest-api-docs-pr/commits/main/docs-ref-autogen/power-bi/Imports/Post-Import-In-Group.yml

So even weirder, I didn't have a clone of this repo, so I cloned it and added an upstream and pulled it down locally.  When I open the post-import.yml file, the changes are there.


And looking at the repo, it is there.




I would probably make a minor change to the doc and merge that, so it re-publishes. That will at least get the doc live. Not sure as to the root cause.



Side questions, these docs reside in a folder called docs-ref-autogen. 

1. Where these updates manually made by the PM?
2. Will these changes be overwritten if/when the auto generated content is refreshed?
3. Should these changes be added to the source so that if/when they are auto generated, it won't be overwritten?

Sorry I am not 100% up on the process yet for the auto-generated API content.  :-)
