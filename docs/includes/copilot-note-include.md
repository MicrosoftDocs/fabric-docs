> - Your F2 or P1 capacity needs to be in one of the regions listed in this article, [Fabric region availability](../admin/region-availability.md).
> - If your tenant or capacity is outside the US or EU, Copilot is disabled by default. Your Fabric tenant admin will also need to enable the [Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be processed outside your capacity's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot) tenant setting in the Fabric Admin portal to use Copilot.
