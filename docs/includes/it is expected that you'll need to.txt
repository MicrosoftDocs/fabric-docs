it is expected that you'll need to manually map the gateway in the target dataset settings at least once. also, when changing the target data source by deploying with a rule for the first time it also makes sense to need to set up the gateway mapping manually again in the target for the updated data source - just once. following deployments that do no change the data source are not expected to reset this selection.
