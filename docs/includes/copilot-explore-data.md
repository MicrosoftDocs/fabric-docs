1. Continue exploring and drilling through the data by asking more questions or modifying the visual manually using the **Visual Options** pane. For more information on customizing the visual, see [Customize Real-Time Dashboard visuals](../real-time-intelligence/dashboard-visuals-customize.md).

1. When you're ready to save your insights to the dashboard, select **Save to dashboard**. This action saves the current view and query as a new tile on the dashboard.

   Each saved tile stays connected to your live data, so as the data updates, your visual does too.
