By November 30, 2025, all Power BI *default* semantic models are disconnected from their item and become independent semantic models. You can retain them if you still use them for reports or dashboards or delete them safely if they are no longer needed. For more information, see [Blog: Decoupling Default Semantic Models for Existing Items in Microsoft Fabric](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/decoupling-default-semantic-models-for-existing-in-microsoft-fabric?ft=All).
- Since September 5, 2025, Power BI *default* semantic models are no longer created automatically when a warehouse, lakehouse, or mirrored item is created. For more information, see [Blog: Sunsetting Default Semantic Models](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/sunsetting-default-semantic-models-microsoft-fabric). 
- If your item doesn't have a semantic model already, you can [create a Power BI semantic model](/fabric/data-warehouse/create-semantic-model).
