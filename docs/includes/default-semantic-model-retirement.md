Starting August 25, 2025, Power BI *default* semantic models are no longer created automatically when a warehouse, lakehouse, or mirrored item is created. If your item doesn't have a semantic model already, you can [create a Power BI semantic model](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/semantic-models#create-a-new-power-bi-semantic-model). Existing default semantic models will be converted to regular semantic models. For more information, see [Sunsetting Default Semantic Models](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/sunsetting-default-semantic-models-microsoft-fabric).
