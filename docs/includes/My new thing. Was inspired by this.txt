My new thing. Was inspired by this today.

We have auto generated REST API content that comes from swagger files.
We also have manual documentation in the dev repo for the API docs.  In those files, there are tables that summarize what is in the auto-generated content.  So developers can look at this and easily find what they are looking for instead of drilling into the auto-generated files.
So my thing is, can I get Copilot to read through the swagger files and automatically create the tables for me.  I know we can do this, just not sure how easy it is to read from the source code> :-P
And will it be correct.  

The manual way seems like such a pain.  I want to automate it.  This is the way.
