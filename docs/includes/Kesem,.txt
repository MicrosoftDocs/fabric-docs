Kesem,

Do you know if we have access to the Fabric REST API swagger files?

I am looking to do the following:
  
	1. Read-only to verify information is in the file that is being auto-generated

Example:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/digitaltwinbuilderflow/items/create-digital-twin-builder-flow?tabs=HTTP

Eva, wants me to update the NOTE (The API is in preview).  Legal gave her one to put in the documentation.  But I am unaware if this is coming from the swagger file or if it was manually added after.

	2. Possibly updating the swagger files for PM.  Do you do this or have you ever done this?  Or do you have PM/Dev do it?

Thanks!

Bill
