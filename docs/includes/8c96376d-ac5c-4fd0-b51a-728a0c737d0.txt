By default, the variable libraries active set is, set to the default value for each stage.  You can change this by accessing the variable library in each step of the deployment pipline and setting the active set.  For instance, under the Test deployment pipeline, you can access the variable library and set the Test values as active.


- While the *selected active value set* in each stage is unaffected by deployments, the values themselves can be updated in the deployment pipeline. The consumer item (for example, a pipeline) automatically receives the correct value from the active value set.


The following operations to variables or value sets in one stage of a deployment pipeline, cause the variable library to be reflected as *different* [compared](../deployment-pipelines/compare-pipeline-content.md) to the same item in a different stage.

* added, deleted, or edited variables
* added or deleted value sets
* names of variables
* order of variables

A simple change to the **active value set** doesn't register as *different* when you compare, since the active value set is part of the item configuration, but it is not included in its definition. This is why it is not shown on the Deployment pipeline 'Compare' and not overwritten on each deployment.Â
