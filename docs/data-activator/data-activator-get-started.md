# Get started with Data Activator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data Activator is currently in preview.

The first step in using Data Activator is for your administrator to enable Data Activator for your organization. The following image shows where to enable Data Activator in the Admin portal.

Next, select the Data Activator experience in Microsoft Fabric, then select it from the menu at the bottom of the screen to tailor your Fabric experience to Data Activator.

## Create a reflex item

As with all Fabric experiences, you begin using Data Activator by creating an item in a Fabric Workspace. Data Activator’s items are called *reflexes.*

A reflex holds all the information necessary to connect to data, monitor for conditions, and act. You'll typically create a reflex for each business process or area you’re monitoring.

To get started, you create a reflex item in your Fabric workspace. From the New menu in the workspace, choose the **Reflex** item.

## Navigate between data mode and design mode

When you open a reflex, you see two tabs at the bottom of the screen that switch between **data mode** and **design mode**. In data mode, you can see your incoming data and assign it to objects. In design mode, you build triggers from your objects. At first, these will be empty; the next step after creating a reflex is to populate it with your data.

Once you have created a reflex, you need to populate it with your data. Learn how to get data into your reflex from the [Get data for Data Activator from Power BI](data-activator-get-data-power-bi.md) and [Get data for Data Activator from Eventstreams](data-activator-get-data-eventstreams.md) articles.
