## Key highlights

### Apache Spark 3.5
[Apache Spark 3.5.0](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-5-0.html) is the sixth version in the 3.x series. This version is a product of extensive collaboration within the open-source community, addressing more than 1,300 issues as recorded in Jira.

In this version, there's an upgrade in compatibility for structured streaming. Additionally, this release broadens the functionality within PySpark and SQL. It adds features such as the SQL identifier clause, named arguments in SQL function calls, and the inclusion of SQL functions for HyperLogLog approximate aggregations. Other new capabilities also include Python user-defined table functions, the simplification of distributed training via *DeepSpeed*, and new structured streaming capabilities like watermark propagation and the *dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark* operation.
