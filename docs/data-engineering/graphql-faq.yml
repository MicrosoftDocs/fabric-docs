      - question: What is GraphQL?
        answer: |
          GraphQL is a query language for APIs that lets apps request exactly the data they need. Key benefits include:
          
          - **Strong type system** - Clearly describes available data
          - **Precise data fetching** - Reduces over-fetching by allowing specific requests
          - **Backward compatibility** - Makes API updates easier without breaking existing code
          - **Rich tooling** - Enables use of a broad set of developer tools
          
          It's a more efficient way for applications to communicate with servers and databases.

      - question: What is Microsoft Fabric API for GraphQL?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Fabric API for GraphQL is a managed service that enables you to create a GraphQL API in seconds.
          
          **Supported data sources:**
          - Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouses
          - Microsoft Fabric Lakehouses
          - Microsoft Fabric Mirrored Databases
          - Microsoft Fabric SQL Databases
          - Azure SQL Databases
          
          It provides a unified API layer for querying and mutating data from these supported data sources.

      - question: What GraphQL operations are supported in Fabric API for GraphQL?
        answer: Only GraphQL queries (read) and mutations (write) are supported currently. Data sources exposed via SQL Analytics Endpoints are read-only thus only supporting Queries. For Data Warehouses, a primary key needs to be defined for mutations to be automatically generated.

      - question: How can I view and edit resolvers in Fabric API for GraphQL?
        answer: |
          Resolvers are GraphQL components that provide the business logic to resolve fields in the API and perform operations with data residing in the data sources.
          
          **Automatic generation:** Fabric automatically generates resolvers whenever you attach a new data source or select new objects to be exposed from an existing data source.
          
          **Customization:** Currently, it's not possible to customize resolvers directly. For customized business logic in API for GraphQL, you can create a [stored procedure](api-graphql-stored-procedures.md) in the data source and expose it in the GraphQL API.

      - question: Does the API for GraphQL client application require access to the data source in order to perform queries or mutations?
        answer: |
          **Microsoft Entra ID authentication:** API for GraphQL requires applications to use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. Your client application must be registered and configured to execute API calls against Fabric.
          
          **Required permissions:**
          - The app registered in Microsoft Entra requires *GraphQLApi.Execute.All* permissions for the Power BI service. For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Entra app in Azure](/rest/api/fabric/articles/get-started/create-entra-app).
          
          **Single sign-on (SSO) configuration:**
          If the API is configured to use SSO, the authenticated user or service principal [requires access](connect-apps-api-graphql.md#authentication-and-permissions-summary) to both:
          - The GraphQL API (*Run Queries and Mutations* permission)
          - The data source (read or write access as needed)
          
          **Workspace-level access option:**
          Alternatively, assign the user or service principal as a workspace member with a *contributor role* where both the API and data source items are located. This gives the required access to both items from a single place. For more information, see [Give users access to workspaces](../fundamentals/give-access-workspaces.md).
          
          **Saved credentials configuration:**
          If the API is configured to use saved credentials, the authenticated user or service principal only needs access to the API (select *Run Queries and Mutations* option when adding direct access permissions to the API).
          
          **Examples:** You can find an end-to-end example with sample code for both user principals and [service principals](api-graphql-service-principal.md) at [Connect Applications](connect-apps-api-graphql.md).

      - question: How do I open a support ticket for API for GraphQL?
        answer: To get help from Microsoft Support on any issue related to Fabric API for GraphQL, visit our [Fabric Support site](https://support.fabric.microsoft.com/support/) and choose the **Data Engineering** option.

      - question: Does API for GraphQL support Private Link?
        answer: API for GraphQL doesn't support Private Link at this time.

      - question: Why does my request perform poorly the first time I issue it, then perform well on subsequent requests?
        answer: |
          There are two main reasons for this "cold start" behavior:
          
          **Data source warm-up:**
          - The first request might take longer if a data source needs to be warmed up from a cold state
          - Even if the data source isn't cold, data retrieval might not be as efficient the first time GraphQL issues a query if the data source doesn't have the necessary data loaded in memory
          
          **API endpoint initialization:**
          - The first request to an API for GraphQL endpoint might take longer because the system needs to load your schema and configuration
          - Subsequent requests are faster because the system is already warmed up and ready to serve your requests
          
          You can find more information in the [performance best practices](api-graphql-performance.md).
