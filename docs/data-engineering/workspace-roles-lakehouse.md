# Workspace roles in Lakehouse

Workspace roles define what user can do with Microsoft Fabric items. Roles can be assigned to individuals or security groups from workspace view. See, [Give users access to workspaces](../get-started/give-access-workspaces.md).

The user can be assigned to the following roles:

* Admin
* Member
* Contributor
* Viewer

In a lakehouse the users with Admin, Member, and Contributor roles can perform all CRUD operations on all data. A user with Viewer role can only read data stored in Tables using the [SQL analytics endpoint](lakehouse-sql-analytics-endpoint.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When accessing data using the SQL analytics endpoint with Viewer role, **make sure SQL access policy is granted to read required tables**.
