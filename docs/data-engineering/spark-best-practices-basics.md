# Spark Basics

Core concepts underpinning sizing, optimization, and troubleshooting. Read this first if you're new to Spark in Fabric.

## General Dos and Don'ts
##### Scenario: You're new to Spark. What are the Dos and Don'ts

| Use case | Best practices |
|---|---|
| Use optimized serialized formats | Do: Prefer formats like Avro, Parquet, or Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) because they embed schema, are compact, and optimize storage and processing. In Fabric, use Delta format for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) guarantees and performance benefits |
| Be cautious with XML/JSON | Don't rely on schema inference for large JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) files, as Spark reads the entire dataset to infer schema, which slows down processing and consumes memory intensively.<br/><br/>Provide a static primary schema when reading JSON/XML or use `.option("samplingRatio", 0.1)` to speed up reads, but be aware that if the sample doesn't represent the full dataset, reads might fail. A safer approach infers schema from a representative sample and persists it for all reads.<br/><br/>Avoid parsing large XML files. XML parsing runs inherently slower due to tag processing and type casting. |
| Optimize joins & filtering | Do: Apply column pruning and row-level filtering before joins to reduce shuffle and memory usage.<br/><br/>The Catalyst optimizer automatically handles predicate pushdown when you use DataFrame APIs. Avoid Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs because they bypass Catalyst optimizations. |
| Prefer DataFrames over RDDs | Do: Use DataFrames instead of RDDs for most operations. DataFrames use the Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten execution engine for efficient execution. |
| Enable adaptive query execution (AQE) | Do: Turn on AQE to dynamically optimize shuffle partitions and handle skewed data automatically. |

## Executor Memory Management

##### Scenario: You want to understand the executor memory management for performance tuning.

Even if an executor is configured with 56 GB memory, Spark doesn't allow all of it to be used directly for user data. Spark Core divides and manages executor memory:

- **Reserved Memory:** A fixed portion reserved for system and Spark internal overhead (for example, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), internals).

- **User Memory:** Stores User Defined Functions (UDFs), local variables, data structures (lists, maps, dictionaries), and objects created during computation.

- **Storage Memory:** Holds cached/persisted data, broadcast variables, and shuffle data that can be cached.

- **Execution Memory:** Used for intermediate computation (shuffles, joins, sorts, aggregations).

- **Dynamic Memory Sharing:** The boundary between Storage and Execution memory is movable. Spark can borrow memory from one region to the other, allowing flexible memory usage.

- **Spill:** Occurs when either Storage or Execution memory demand exceeds the memory available after borrowing. This forces data to disk, which can affect performance.

## Out of Memory (OOM) Errors

##### Scenario: Spark jobs fail with Out of Memory (OOM) Errors.

**Driver OOM:**

Driver OOM errors occur when the Spark driver exceeds its allocated memory.

Common cause: driver-heavy operations such as `collect()`, `countByKey()`, or large `toPandas()` calls that pull too much data into driver memory.

Mitigation: Avoid driver-heavy operations whenever possible. If unavoidable, increase the driver size and benchmark to find the optimal configuration.

**Executor Out of Memory (OOM):**

Executor OOM errors occur when a Spark executor exceeds its allocated memory.

Common cause: Memory- and compute-intensive transformations on large datasets (for example, wide joins, aggregations, shuffles) or cached/persisted datasets that exceed the executor's available memory (execution + storage regions).

Mitigation: Increase executor memory if necessary, tune the Spark memory fractions (spark.memory.fraction, spark.memory.storageFraction) and persist selectively. Ensure that cached data fits into available memory.

**Data Skews**

Symptoms of skew:

- A few tasks take longer than others in the Spark UI (stage tasks show heavy tail).  
- Large gap between median and max task times in stage metrics.  
- Stages with large shuffle read or write sizes for a few partitions.

Common causes:

- Uneven data distribution for the join/group keys (hot keys).  
- Incorrect partitioning or too-few partitions for the data volume.  
- Upstream data anomalies that produce large records or many null/empty keys.

Mitigation:

- Repartition or coalesce to increase partition parallelism and balance sizes.  
- Apply key salting or custom partitioning to spread hot keys across partitions.  
- Use AQE (Adaptive Query Execution) to coalesce post-shuffle partitions and enable skew-join optimizations.  
- Use broadcast joins for small lookup tables to avoid shuffles entirely.  
- Persist balanced intermediate datasets before expensive stages and re-run the job.

## UDF Best Practices 

##### Scenario: You need to apply custom logic that can't be expressed via built-in DataFrame functions.

Use Spark DataFrame APIs whenever possible. The Catalyst optimizer optimizes built-in functions and runs them natively on the JVM, so they deliver the best performance.

If you must use a UDF (User Defined Function), avoid regular PySpark Python UDFs. Instead, consider the following alternatives:

- Pandas UDFs (also known as Vectorized UDFs): Use Apache Arrow for efficient data transfer between JVM and Python. Pandas UDFs allow vectorized operations, significantly improving performance compared to row-by-row Python UDFs.

- Scala/Java UDFs: Run directly on the JVM, avoiding Python serialization overhead. Scala/Java UDFs typically outperform Python UDFs.

Be cautious with Python UDFs. Each executor launches a separate Python process, requiring serialization and deserialization of data between the JVM and Python. This creates a performance bottleneck, particularly at scale. 

## Error Logging

##### Scenario: Best Practices for Error Logging in Fabric Spark

1. Use `log4j` instead of `print()` which burdens the driver heavily. With `log4j`, you can access logs in driver logs and search them (using the logger name, for example: PySparkLogger).

    :::image type="content" source="media/spark-best-practices/spark-event-logs.jpeg" alt-text="Diagram of Spark logs." lightbox="media/spark-best-practices/spark-event-logs.jpeg":::

1. Wrap reads, writes, and transformations in try and except blocks. Use `logger.error` for exceptions and `logger.info` for progress messages.

- **Python logging:** Ideal for logging operations, status updates, or debugging information from code that executes only on the Spark Driver. Python's logging module doesn't propagate to executor logs. Reference: /fabric/data-engineering/author-execute-notebook#python-logging-in-a-notebook

- **Spark log4j:** The standard for robust, production-level application logging in Spark as it integrates natively with Spark's driver/executor logs.

    Sample log4j usage in PySpark:
    
        ```python
        import traceback
        # Get log4j logger
        log4jLogger = spark._jvm.org.apache.log4j
        logger = log4jLogger.LogManager.getLogger("PySparkLogger")
        logger.info("Application started.")
        try:
           # Create DataFrame with 20 records
           data = [(f"Name{i}", i) for i in range(1, 21)]  # 20 records
           df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["name", "age"])
           logger.info("DataFrame created successfully with 20 records.")
           df.show(s)  # 's' is not defined -> will throw error but the application will not fail
        except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Error while creating or showing DataFrame: {str(e)}\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
        ```

1. Centralize error monitoring:
    
    - Use diagnostic emitter extension ([Monitor Apache Spark applications with Azure Log Analytics](/fabric/data-engineering/azure-fabric-diagnostic-emitters-log-analytics#available-apache-spark-configurations)) in environment and attach to the Notebooks running Spark applications. The emitter can send event logs, custom logs (like log4j), and metrics to Azure Log Analytics/Azure Storage/Azure Event Hubs. Pass the log4j name to the property: `spark.synapse.diagnostic.emitter.\<destination\>.filter.loggerName.match`.
    
    - Additionally for debugging, you can also collect failed rows/records to Lakehouse (LH) tables for record level bad data capture.
