# How to integrate notebooks with Org app

This article shows you how to integrate notebooks into an app. This new integration is designed to enhance your productivity by using Notebook as a rich content carrier and streamline your workflow by providing a seamless experience within [Org app](/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-items), making it easier than ever to interact with data insights.

You can now easily embed the Fabric Notebook in the Org app. With rich content like code and markdown cells, visuals, tables, charts, and widgets, the notebook can be a practical storytelling tool, similar to dashboards. By following the steps below, you'll be able to add a specific notebook to an Org app. The notebook will become read-only within the app context, but widgets like rich dataframe previews, built-in charts, and outputs from popular libraries like Plotly will remain interactive. This will enable app consumers to explore and interact with the notebook conveniently.

The operations applied to the embedded Notebook in Org app by consumers won't be saved, after refreshing the page, all the settings will be reset to default view.
