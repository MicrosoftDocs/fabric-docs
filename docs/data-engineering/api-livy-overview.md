# What is the Livy API for Data Engineering? (Preview)

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-de-and-ds](includes/fabric-de-ds.md)]

Microsoft Fabric Livy API lets users submit and execute Spark code within Spark compute associated with a Fabric Lakehouse, eliminating the need to create any Notebook or Spark Job Definition artifacts. This integration with the Lakehouse ensures straightforward access to data stored on OneLake.

## Features

The Fabric Livy API allows submitting jobs in two different modes:

- Session Jobs
  - A Livy session job entails establishing a Spark session that remains active throughout the interaction with the Livy API. Livy Sessions are useful for interactive workloads.
  - A Spark session starts when a job is submitted and lasts until the user ends it or the system terminates it after 20 minutes of inactivity. Throughout the session, multiple jobs can run, sharing state and cached data between runs.
- Batch Jobs
  - A Livy batch job entails submitting a Spark application for a single job execution. In contrast to a Livy session job, a batch job doesn't sustain an ongoing Spark session.
  - With Livy batch jobs, each job initiates a new Spark session that ends when the job finishes. This approach works well for tasks that don't rely on previous computations or require maintaining state between jobs.
