# What is the Fabric Data Engineering VS Code extension?

The [Fabric Data Engineering VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SynapseVSCode.synapse) supports a pro-developer experience for exploring Microsoft Fabric lakehouses, and authoring Fabric notebooks and Spark job definitions. 

In this article, you learn more about the extension, including how to get started with the necessary prerequisites.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a one of the most popular lightweight source code editors; it runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. By installing the Fabric Data Engineering VS Code extension, you can author, run, and debug your notebook and Spark job definition locally in VS Code. You can also post the code to the remote Spark compute in your Fabric workspace to run or debug. The extension also allows you to browse your lakehouse data, including tables and raw files, in VS Code.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites for the VS Code extension:

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Install the [Jupyter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Install the extension and prepare your environment

1. Search for **Fabric Data Engineering VS Code** in the VS Code extension marketplace and install the extension.

1. After the extension installation completes, restart VS Code. VS Code lists the icon for the extension at the activity bar.

### Access the command palette

You can access many of the extension's features through the VS Code command palette. To open the command palette:

- On Windows/Linux: Press **Ctrl+Shift+P**
- On macOS: Press **Cmd+Shift+P**

Alternatively, you can access it from the menu by selecting **View** > **Command Palette**.

Once the command palette opens, start typing the command name (for example, "Fabric Data Engineering") to filter and find the commands the extension provides.

### Local working directory

To edit a notebook, you must have a local copy of the notebook content. The local working directory of the extension serves as the local root folder for all downloaded notebooks, even notebooks from different workspaces. By invoking the command `Fabric Data Engineering: Set Local Work Folder`, you can specify a folder as the local working directory for the extension.

To validate the setup, open the extension settings and check the details there:

### Sign in and out of your account

1. From the VS Code command palette, enter the `Fabric Data Engineering: Sign In` command to sign in to the extension. A separate browser sign-in page appears.

1. Enter your username and password.

1. After you successfully sign in, the VS Code status bar displays your username to indicate that you're signed in.

1. To sign out of the extension, enter the command `Fabric Data Engineering: Sign Out`.

### Choose a workspace to work with

To select a Fabric workspace:

1. You must have a workspace created. If you don't have one, you can create one in the Fabric portal. For more information, see [Create a workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md).

1. Once you have a workspace, choose it by selecting the **Select Workspace** option. A list appears of all workspaces that you have access to; select the one you want from the list.
