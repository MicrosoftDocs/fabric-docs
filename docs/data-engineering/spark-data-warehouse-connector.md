# Spark connector for Microsoft Fabric data warehouses

The Spark connector for Microsoft Fabric data warehouses enables Spark developers and data scientists to access and work with data from a data warehouse and the SQL analytics endpoint of a lakehouse. The connector offers the following capabilities:

* You can work with data from both the data warehouse and the SQL analytics endpoint from the same workspace or across multiple workspaces.
* The SQL engine's endpoint is automatically discovered based on workspace context.
* The connector has a simplified Spark API, abstracts the underlying complexity, and operates with just one line of code.
* While you're accessing a table or a view, the connector upholds security models defined at the SQL engine level. These models include object-level security (OLS), row-level security (RLS), and column-level security (CLS).
* The connector comes preinstalled within the Fabric runtime, which eliminates the need for separate installation.

> [!NOTE]
> The connector is currently in preview. For more information, see the [current limitations](spark-data-warehouse-connector.md#current-limitations) later in this article.  

## Authentication

Microsoft Entra authentication is an integrated authentication approach. Users sign in to the Microsoft Fabric workspace, and their credentials are automatically passed to the SQL engine for authentication and authorization. The credentials are automatically mapped, and users aren't required to provide specific configuration options.

### Permissions

To connect to the SQL engine, users need at least Read permission (similar to CONNECT permission in SQL Server) on the data warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint (item level). Users also need granular object-level permissions to read data from specific tables or views. To learn more, see [Security for data warehousing in Microsoft Fabric](../data-warehouse/security.md).

## Code templates and examples

### Use a method signature

The following command shows the `synapsesql` method signature for the read request. The three-part `tableName` argument is required for accessing tables or views from a Fabric data warehouse and the SQL analytics endpoint of a lakehouse. Update the argument with the following names, based on your scenario:

* Part 1: Name of the warehouse or lakehouse.
* Part 2: Name of the schema.
* Part 3: Name of the table or view.

```scala
synapsesql(tableName:String="<Part 1.Part 2.Part 3>") => org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame
```

### Read data within the same workspace

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run these import statements at the beginning of your notebook or before you start using the connector:
>
> `import com.microsoft.spark.fabric.tds.implicits.read.FabricSparkTDSImplicits._`
>
> `import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._`

The following code is an example to read data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame:

```scala
val df = spark.read.synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>")
```

The following code is an example to read data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame with a row count limit of 10:

```scala
val df = spark.read.synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>").limit(10)
```

The following code is an example to read data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame after you apply a filter:

```scala
val df = spark.read.synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>").filter("column name == 'value'")
```

The following code is an example to read data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame for selected columns only:

```scala
val df = spark.read.synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>").select("column A", "Column B")
```

### Read data across workspaces

To access and read data from a warehouse or lakehouse across workspaces, you can specify the workspace ID where your warehouse or lakehouse exists. This line provides an example of reading data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame from the warehouse or lakehouse from the specified workspace ID:

```scala
import com.microsoft.spark.fabric.Constants
val df = spark.read.option(Constants.WorkspaceId, "<workspace id>").synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>")
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you're running the notebook, by default the connector looks for the specified warehouse or lakehouse in the workspace of the lakehouse that's attached to the notebook. To reference a warehouse or lakehouse from another workspace, specify the workspace ID.

### Use materialized data across cells and languages

You can use the Spark DataFrame's `createOrReplaceTempView` API to access data fetched in one cell or in Scala (after you register it as a temporary view) by another cell in Spark SQL or PySpark. These lines of code provide an example to read data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame in Scala and use this data across Spark SQL and PySpark:

```scala
%%spark
spark.read.synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>").createOrReplaceTempView("<Temporary View Name>")
```

Now, change the language preference on the notebook or at the cell level to Spark SQL, and fetch the data from the registered temporary view:

```scala
%%sql
SELECT * FROM <Temporary View Name> LIMIT 100
```

Next, change the language preference on the notebook or at the cell level to PySpark (Python), and fetch data from the registered temporary view:

```scala
%%pyspark
df = spark.read.table("<Temporary View Name>")
```

### Create a lakehouse table based on data from a data warehouse

These lines of code provide an example to read data from a table or view in a Spark DataFrame in Scala and use it to create a lakehouse table:

```scala
val df = spark.read.synapsesql("<warehouse/lakehouse name>.<schema name>.<table or view name>")
df.write.format("delta").saveAsTable("<Lakehouse table name>")
```

## Troubleshoot

Upon completion, the read response snippet appears in the cell's output. Failure in the current cell also cancels subsequent cell executions of the notebook. Detailed error information is available in the Spark application logs.

## Current limitations

Currently, the connector:

* Supports data retrieval from Fabric data warehouses and SQL endpoints of lakehouse items.
* Supports Scala only.
* Doesn't support custom queries or query pass-through.
* Doesn't implement pushed-down optimization.
* Retains the usage signature like the one shipped with Apache Spark for Azure Synapse Analytics for consistency. However, it's not backward compatible to connect and work with a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics.
