# Manage Fabric materialized lake views lineage

Fabric materialized lake views (MLVs) are an efficient way to manage and query large datasets by pre computing and storing the results of a query. In a fabric environment, managing these views effectively can significantly enhance performance and reduce query times.

This document delves into the various aspects of managing Fabric MLVs, including understanding the lineage, scheduling the MLV runs, exploring the history of MLVs, and detailing operational run specifics.

## View lineage

A lineage is a fundamental structure for managing dependencies and scheduling tasks. In the context of MLVs, the lineage represents the sequence of MLV that needs to be executed to refresh the MLV once new data is available.

After you create the MLV, select **Manage materialized lake views** to navigate to the MLV lineage.

## Materialized lake views Lineage

The lineage or MLV flow is defined per the code written by the user in the notebook. It's created after the MLV end-to-end flow is created.

> [!Important]
> Table Shortcuts from MLV to a Lakehouse in Lineage are not supported.

To run the lineage, schedule the lineage as per your requirement. Once the job Graph is scheduled, navigate to the current run and check the lineage view.

## Understand the lineage view

The lineage for an MLV ensures that data is processed in the correct order, respecting all the dependencies. Each node in the lineage represents a specific operation, such as reading from a source table or performing a transformation. Arrows between nodes signify the dependencies, dictating the execution order. You can select a particular node to understand the flow right from the source tables and parent nodes to the dependent nodes as well.

The lineage UI also has the following functionalities:

* **Refresh:** This option lets you refresh the lineage UI to reflect any recent changes in status.

  > [!NOTE]
  > * This is a lineage UI refresh only and not a data refresh.
  > * Lineage UI is auto refreshed for every 2 minutes when there's an ongoing run or if the user's browser tab is active.

* **New materialized lake view:** You can open a notebook to make changes to the MLVs per your requirements.

  > [!NOTE]
  > These notebooks aren't directly linked to a lineage UI and are used to create an MLV.

* **Schedule:** You can schedule a run as per your business requirements and refresh the MLVs when new data is present.

* **Toggle View:** You can now toggle the view to *Portrait or Landscape* view depending on the size of the lineage.

* **Reset lineage** You can adjust the lineage UI according to the screen size using this option.
