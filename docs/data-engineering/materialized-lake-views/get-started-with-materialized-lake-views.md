# Get started with materialized lake views

In this article, you learn how to get started with materialized lake views by creating one in a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity).
* A lakehouse with [lakehouse schemas](../lakehouse-schemas.md) enabled.
* [Fabric Runtime 1.3](../runtime-1-3.md). Materialized lake views are compatible with this runtime version.

## Create your first materialized lake view

1. Go to your lakehouse and select **Manage materialized lake views**.

1. Select **New materialized lake view**, and then select **New notebook**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/new-materialized-lake-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selections for opening a new notebook to create a materialized lake view." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/new-materialized-lake-view.png":::

   A new notebook opens.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/materialized-lake-view-notebook.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a notebook template to create a materialized lake view." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/materialized-lake-view-notebook.png":::

1. Create the sample source tables `products` and `orders`. Run the following commands in the notebook:

   ```sql
      CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS bronze;

      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bronze.products (
       product_id INT,
       product_name STRING,
       price DOUBLE
      );

      INSERT INTO bronze.products VALUES
      (101, 'Laptop', 1200.50),
      (102, 'Smartphone', 699.99),
      (103, 'Tablet', 450.00);
   ```

   ```sql

      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bronze.orders (
        order_id INT,
        product_id INT,
        quantity INT,
        order_date DATE
       );
      INSERT INTO bronze.orders VALUES
       (1001, 101, 2, '2025-06-01'),
       (1002, 103, 1, '2025-06-02'),
       (1003, 102, 3, '2025-06-03');
   ```

1. Create materialized lake views by using the source tables. Run the following commands in the notebook:

   ```sql
      CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS SILVER;
   
      CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS silver.cleaned_order_data AS
      SELECT 
          o.order_id,
          o.order_date,
          o.product_id,
          p.product_name,
          o.quantity,
          p.price,
          o.quantity * p.price AS revenue
      FROM bronze.orders o
      JOIN bronze.products p
      ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
   ```

   ```sql
      CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS GOLD;
   
      CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS gold.product_sales_summary AS
      SELECT
          product_id,
          product_name,
          SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
          SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
          ROUND(AVG(revenue), 2) AS average_order_value
      FROM
          silver.cleaned_order_data
      GROUP BY
          product_id,
          product_name;
   ```

1. Open the lakehouse explorer to view all created tables and materialized lake views.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/materialized-lake-views-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows materialized lake views created in a lakehouse." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/materialized-lake-views-created.png":::

1. In your lakehouse, go to **Manage materialized lake views** to view the autogenerated lineage.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/sample-lineage.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows lineage." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/sample-lineage.png":::
  
1. Schedule the lineage execution.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/schedule-lineage-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pane for scheduling lineage." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/schedule-lineage-run.png":::

1. Select the ongoing run to monitor progress after the schedule starts.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/ongoing-run-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the progress of an ongoing run." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/ongoing-run-progress.png":::

1. After the run succeeds, the status of the lineage is **Completed**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/completed-lineage-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a completed lineage run." border="true" lightbox="./media/get-started-with-materialized-lake-views/completed-lineage-run.png":::
