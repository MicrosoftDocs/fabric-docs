# Schedule a materialized lake view run

Scheduling the materialized lake view (MLV) run lets users set how often the MLV should be refreshed based on business needs and lineage execution timing.

## Determining the schedule

The schedule to run the MLV depends on various factors, such as:

* **Data update frequency:** The frequency with which the data is updated.
* **Query performance requirements:** Business requirement to refresh the data in defined frequent intervals.
* **System load:** Optimizing the time to run the lineage without overloading the system

## Implement the schedule

From the **Manage materialized lake views** page, select the **Schedule** option.

The schedule UI opens and is visible to the user.

Turn **On** the **Schedule Refresh** option and select the following from the schedule UI:

* Repeat (By the minute/Hourly/Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
* Every (Frequency/Date/Time/Month)
* Start Date
* End Date and Time
* Time Zone

Select **Apply** to set the schedule for the particular MLV run.

> [!NOTE]
> * The scheduler reflects the user's local time.
> * A materialized lake view fails if it runs beyond 24 hours.
