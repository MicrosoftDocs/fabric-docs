# Materialized lake views Spark SQL reference

In this article, you learn about syntax of materialized lake views using Spark SQL. For more information about materialized lake views, see [overview of materialized lake views](./overview-materialized-lake-view.md).

## Create materialized lake view

A materialized lake view can be defined from any table or another materialized lake view within the lakehouse. The following outlines the syntax for declaring a materialized lake view using Spark SQL. 

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS][workspace.lakehouse.schema].MLV_Identifier 
[( 
    CONSTRAINT constraint_name1 CHECK (condition expression1)[ON MISMATCH DROP | FAIL],  
    CONSTRAINT constraint_name2 CHECK (condition expression2)[ON MISMATCH DROP | FAIL] 
)] 
[PARTITIONED BY (col1, col2, ... )] 
[COMMENT “description or comment”] 
[TBLPROPERTIES (“key1”=”val1”, “key2”=”val2”, ... )] 
AS select_statement 
```

**Arguments**

|Parameter|Description|	
|-|-|
| MLV_Identifier | Name of the materialized lake view.|
| CONSTRAINT | Keyword to define a data quality constraint, followed by a user-defined name. The constraint applies at the materialized lake view level.|
| CHECK | Use to enforce the condition defined based on certain column values. Mandatory to use when defining constraint.|
| ON MISMATCH | Specify the action to be taken if the given constraint is violated. Possible actions are DROP and FAIL. By default, without this clause, the action is FAIL.|
| PARTITIONED BY | To create partitions based on the column specified.|
| TBLPROPERTIES | A list of key-value pairs that is used to tag the materialized lake view definition.|	
| COMMENT | A statement to describe the materialized lake view.|
| AS select_statement | A query to populate the data in the materialized lake view using select statement.| 

The following example illustrates the definition of a materialized lake view named “customers_enriched” by joining the **customers** table with the **orders** table.
 
 ```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS silver.customers_enriched AS 
SELECT 
    c.customerID, 
    c.customerName, 
    c.contact, 
    CASE  
       WHEN COUNT(o.orderID) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customerID) > 0 THEN TRUE  
       ELSE FALSE  
       END AS has_orders 
FROM bronze.customers c LEFT JOIN bronze.orders o 
ON c.customerID = o.customerID; 
 ```

The following example defines a materialized lake view called "customers_enriched," partitioned by the "city" column.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS silver.customers_enriched 
COMMENT "This is a sample materialzied view" 
PARTITIONED BY (city)
SELECT 
     c.customerID, 
     c.customerName, 
     c.contact, 
     CASE  
        WHEN COUNT(o.orderID) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customerID) > 0 THEN TRUE  
        ELSE FALSE  
        END AS has_orders 
FROM bronze.customers c LEFT JOIN bronze.orders o 
ON c.customerID = o.customerID; 
```

## Get the list of materialized lake views 

To obtain the list of all materialized lake views in the lakehouse, use the following command:

**Syntax**
```sql
SHOW MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEWS <IN/FROM> Schema_Name;
```

**Example**

```sql
SHOW MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEWS IN silver;
```

## Retrieve the CREATE statement of a materialized lake view

To get the statement that created a materialized lake view, use this following command:

**Syntax**

```sql
SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW MLV_Identifier;
```

**Example**

```sql
SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW customers_enriched;
```

## Update a materialized lake view
 
To update the definition of a materialized lake view, it must be dropped and recreated. Alter statement is only supported for renaming a materialized lake view.

**Syntax**
```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW MLV_Identifier RENAME TO MLV_Identifier_New;
```

**Example**
```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW customers_enriched RENAME TO customers_enriched_new;
```

## Drop a materialized lake view

The materialized lake view can be dropped using the lakehouse object explorer delete option or by executing the following command in the notebook.

**Syntax**

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW MLV_Identifier;
```

**Example**

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW customers_enriched;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Dropping or renaming a materialized lake view affects the lineage view and scheduled refresh. Ensure you update the reference in all dependent materialized lake views.

## Current limitations

* Spark properties set at the session level aren't applied during scheduled lineage refresh.
* The creation of materialized lake view with delta time-travel isn't supported.
* DML statements aren't supported with materialized lake views.
* User-defined functions in CTAS aren't supported.
* Temporary views can't be used to define materialized lake views.

## Known issues

* Creating a materialized lake view with a CTE works, but subsequent refreshes might fail. In such cases, recreate the view without using a CTE.
