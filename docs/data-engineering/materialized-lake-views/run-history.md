# Run history of materialized lake views

You can access the last 25 runs of a materialized lake view (MLV), including lineage and run metadata. It's available from the dropdown for monitoring and troubleshooting.

You can click on **View more past runs** to see the last 25 runs for MLVs or the runs in the last seven days, whichever comes first.

## Following are the possible states for a run in lineage view

* **Completed**- When all the nodes have executed successfully, the run status is shown as **Completed** state.

* **Failed**- When any one of the nodes fails, the run status is shown as **Failed** state. When the node is in Failed state, the child node is shown in a Skipped state.

* **Skipped**- When the previous run is still ongoing, the current schedule is skipped that run state is shown as **Skipped**.

* **In Progress**- When the run has started and hasn't reached a terminal state, the run state is shown as **In Progress**.

* **Canceled**- When the run is manually canceled by the user from monitoring hub, the run state is shown as **Canceled**.
