# Resource usage APIs

This article explains how to get Spark resource usage information.

## Permissions

The caller must have "read" permission on the item.

## Required delegated scopes

Item.Read.All or Item.ReadWrite.All or one of the following 3 groups (according to the item which triggered the Spark application)

- Notebook.Read.All or Notebook.ReadWrite.All 
- SparkJobDefinition.Read.All or SparkJobDefinition.ReadWrite.All
- Lakehouse.Read.All or Lakehouse.ReadWrite.All

## Microsoft Entra supported identities

This API supports the Microsoft [identities](/rest/api/fabric/articles/identity-support) listed in this section.

| Identity | Support |
| --- | --- |
| User | Yes |
| [Service principal](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) and [Managed identities](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) | Yes |

## Get resource usage timeline

Get all resource usage information as a timeline. 

### Interface

With attemptId
```HTTP
GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/notebooks|sparkJobDefinitions|lakehouses/{itemId}/livySessions/{livyId}/applications/{appId}/{attemptId}/resourceUsage 
```

Without attemptId 
```HTTP
GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/notebooks|sparkJobDefinitions|lakehouses/{itemId}/livySessions/{livyId}/applications/{appId}/resourceUsage
```

With optional parameters:

With attemptId
```HTTP
GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/notebooks|sparkJobDefinitions|lakehouses/{itemId}/livySessions/{livyId}/applications/{appId}/{attemptId}/resourceUsage?jobGroup={jobGroup}&jobLimit={jobLimit}&executorLimit={executorLimit}&executorJobLimit={executorJobLimit}&start={start}&end={end}
```

Without attemptId 
```HTTP
GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/notebooks|sparkJobDefinitions|lakehouses/{itemId}/livySessions/{livyId}/applications/{appId}/resourceUsage?jobGroup={jobGroup}&jobLimit={jobLimit}&executorLimit={executorLimit}&executorJobLimit={executorJobLimit}&start={start}&end={end}
