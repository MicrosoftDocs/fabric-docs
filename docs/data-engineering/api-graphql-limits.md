# Limitations of Microsoft Fabric API for GraphQL

This article details the current limitations in Microsoft Fabric API for GraphQL.

## Limitations

Current general product limitations for API for GraphQL in Microsoft Fabric are listed in this article. We're constantly improving API for GraphQL with new features. For more information on the future of Microsoft Fabric, see [Fabric Roadmap](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-the-fabric-roadmap?ft=All).

- Any data source that leverages a SQL Analytics Endpoint for access only support read operations against it. For example, mutations aren't available for Lakehouses or mirrored databases.
- The current default page size is 100, which means that every request will return a maximum of 100 elements in the reply. If your result set is larger than 100, iterate through results using [GraphQL pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/).
- The maximum pagination size is 100,000. This means that there's a fixed maximum number of elements that a request will return and you're able to iterate through. If you need to return more than 100K elements for your application, issue multiple requests. Understand that this pattern isn't common in GraphQL.
- The maximum reply size we support is 64MB. That means that any API request with a reply size larger than 64MB return an error. To work around this limitation you can either issue multiple filtered requests.
- Limitations for Stored Procedures (Applies to Azure SQL, SQL Database in Fabric, and Data Warehouses):
  - Only the first result set returned by the stored procedure is used by API for GraphQL.
  - Only those stored procedures whose metadata for the first result set described by *sys.dm_exec_describe_first_result_set* are supported.
  - When a stored procedure parameter is specified both in the configuration file and in the URL query string, the parameter in the URL query string takes precedence.
  - Entities backed by a stored procedure don't have all the capabilities automatically provided for entities backed by tables or views.
  - Stored procedure backed entities don't support pagination, ordering, or filtering. Nor do such entities support returning items specified by primary key values.

- The request timeout is currently 100 seconds. This means that if you issue a request that generates a data source query that takes longer than 100 seconds to complete, your request might fail and error out.
- The maximum query depth supported is 10. Query depth is the nesting level of fields in a query, which can impact performance if too deep due to potential recursion and excessive data fetching.
