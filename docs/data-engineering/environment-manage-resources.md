Resources in Fabric environment provide a file system that enables you to manage your files and folders. You can easily access the environment resources from notebook and collaborate with others if the notebooks are attached to the same environment.

## Interact with resources in notebook

When the notebook is attached to an environment, you can easily find the environment resources folder appear in the explorer. Common operations like upload/download/rename/delete/move files and create/delete/rename folders can be done from both environment and notebook UI.

If you drag-and-drop the file with supported type from environment **Resources** folders to a notebook code cell, a code snippet is automatically generated to help you access the file. To learn more, see [Notebook code snippets](author-execute-notebook.md#code-snippets).

> [!NOTE]
> The resource storage has a maximum file size limit of 500MB, with individual files restricted to 50MB, and a total limit of 100 files and folders combined.
