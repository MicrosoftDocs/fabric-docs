# Fabric API for GraphQL schema view and Schema explorer

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Fabric API for GraphQL is in preview.

The GraphQL schema, which is based on the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), defines the format of the data exposed in the API. It's an abstraction layer that provides flexibility to consumers while hiding backend implementation details. The schema is based on a collection of object types that contain fields.

## Schema view

You can access the schema view by selecting **Schema** in the lower left corner of the Data Development screen. The view shows a text-based version of the GraphQL SDL with generated types, fields, and operations.

The following image is an example of the schema view, including an extensive list of objects available in this schema.

> [!NOTE]
> The schema view is read-only. You can only modify objects in the Schema explorer.

## Schema explorer

The **Schema explorer** is located in the pane on the left, and is also available when you use the editor in the query view. The explorer allows users to quickly visualize the available types and fields, as well as queries and mutations, defined in the API.

All the GraphQL types that are available from the objects you choose when you connect to a data source appear in the Schema explorer list. The types appear under the name of the data source from which they were derived. In the following image, you see the **SalesOrderDetail** type derived from the **SalesOrderDetail** table in the **AdventureWorks** SQL analytics endpoint.

In addition to types, the Fabric API for GraphQL automatically generates queries and mutations for any new objects you choose to expose.

In our AdventureWorks example, expanding the list of queries shows the automatically generated queries for the data source.

To see the mutations automatically generated by the API, expand the mutations node in the **Schema explorer** tree.

## Modify objects using the Schema explorer

You can use the Schema explorer to modify objects after the API creates them for you. In the following example, we select the ellipsis next to the **SalesOrderDetail** type derived from our **AdventureWorks** database:

The following options are available:

- **Update schema** - Allows you to update the schema with new objects from the data source.
- **Rename** - Changes the name of the object. PLEASE NOTE: This change **only** affects the API schema, and has no effect on the original data source object from which it was derived.
- **Remove from schema** - Effectively deletes the object from the GraphQL schema so you can no longer reference it.
- **Manage relationships** - Takes you to the relationship management experience. For more information, see [Manage relationships in Fabric API for GraphQL](manage-relationships-graphql.md).
- **Properties** - Shows additional information about the object.
