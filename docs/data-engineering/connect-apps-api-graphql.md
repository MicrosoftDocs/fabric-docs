# Connect applications to Fabric API for GraphQL

To connect an application to an API for GraphQL, you need three important pieces of information: a **Client ID**, your **Tenant ID**, and your **GraphQL endpoint address** in Fabric. In the following sections, we showcase how to create and retrieve all the details you need and how to access your API using a sample application.

## Prerequisites

* Before you connect an application, you must have an API for GraphQL in Fabric. For more information, see [Create an API for GraphQL in Fabric and add data](get-started-api-graphql.md).

* Currently API for GraphQL requires applications to use Microsoft Entra for authentication. Your application needs to be registered and configured adequately to perform API calls against Fabric. For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Entra app in Azure](/rest/api/fabric/articles/get-started/create-entra-app).
  
* The authenticated credential (user principal, service principal, or managed identity) calling the API requires Execute permissions to the GraphQL API (Run Queries and Mutations option when adding direct access permissions) and, if using single sign-on (SSO) as the connectivity option in the API, read or write permissions are required in the data source of choice accordingly. For more information, see [Connect to a data source and build your schema](get-started-api-graphql.md).

## Create a Microsoft Entra app

In the following steps, we showcase how to configure support for a ReactJS application in Microsoft Entra.

1. Register an application using the steps described on [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
2. Your Microsoft Entra app **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** values are displayed in the Summary box. Record these values as they're required later.
1. Under the *Manage* list, select **API permissions**, then **Add permission**. 
2. Add the **PowerBI Service**, select **Delegated permissions**, and select **GraphQLApi.Execute.All** permissions. Make sure admin consent isn't required.
3.  Back to the *Manage* list, select **Authentication** > **Add a platform**, > **Single-page application**.
4.  For local development purposes, add `http://localhost:3000` under **Redirect URIs** and confirm that the application is enabled for the [authorization code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). Select the **Configure** button to save your changes. In case the application receives an error related to cross-origin requests, add the **Mobile and desktop applications** platform in the previous step with the same redirect URI.
5.  Back to **Authentication**, scroll down to **Advanced Settings** and, under **Allow public client flows**, select **Yes** for *Enable the following mobile and desktop flows*.

## Set up a sample GraphQL API for application access

In this example, we create a GraphQL API to expose sample Lakehouse data to clients.

1. From the Fabric portal home page, select **Data Engineering** from the list of workloads.

1. In the Data Engineering experience, select **Use a sample** and, under **Lakehouse**, select **Public holidays** to automatically create a new Lakehouse with public holidays data.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-apps-api-graphql/sample-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot on selecting the sample data Lakehouse option.":::

1. Following the steps from [Create an API for GraphQL](get-started-api-graphql.md), create a new GraphQL API and select the Lakehouse you created. Add the public holidays table to let the clients access this data.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-apps-api-graphql/add-data-to-graphql.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding the sample Lakehouse as GraphQL data source.":::

1. Test the GraphQL API in the [API editor](api-graphql-editor.md) using the following sample query. It's the same query we use in our React client application:

   ```json
    query {
      publicholidays (filter: {countryRegionCode: {eq:"US"}, date: {gte: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", lte: "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}}) {
        items {
          countryOrRegion
          holidayName
          date
        }
      }
    }
   ```

1. Select **Copy endpoint** on the API item's toolbar.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-apps-api-graphql/copy-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the toolbar options for an API item.":::

1. In the **Copy link** screen, select **Copy**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-apps-api-graphql/copy-endpoint-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Copy link dialog screen, showing where to select Copy.":::

1. As the **Client ID** and **Tenant ID** from the Microsoft Entra app recorded earlier, copy the endpoint URI as it's required later.

## Configure a React app to access the public holidays API

> [!NOTE]
>If you prefer to skip the next manual steps, you can clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/tree/main/docs-samples/data-engineering/GraphQL/React) with the complete application, after following step 3 to add specific details about your GraphQL endpoint and Microsoft Entra IDs.

1. We use an existing React app as a starting point. Follow all the steps on the tutorial [Create a React single-page application and prepare it for authentication](/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-single-page-app-react-prepare-spa?tabs=visual-studio-code) to create a React project with Microsoft Entra authentication already configured, including additional files and folders required to be added to the project structure. We only need to change three files to adapt the app for our GraphQL use case.
  
2. In the *src* folder, open the *authConfig.js* file and replace the contents of the file with the following code snippet:

   ```javascript
    /*
     * Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
     * Licensed under the MIT License.
     */
    
    import { LogLevel } from "@azure/msal-browser";
    
    /**
     * Configuration object to be passed to MSAL instance on creation. 
     * For a full list of MSAL.js configuration parameters, visit:
     * https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/configuration.md 
     */
    
    export const graphqlConfig = {
        graphqlEndpoint: "`Enter_the_GraphQL_Endpoint_Here"
    };
    
    export const msalConfig = {
        auth: {
            clientId: "Enter_the_Application_Id_Here",
            authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here",
            redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000",
        },
        cache: {
            cacheLocation: "sessionStorage", // This configures where your cache will be stored
            storeAuthStateInCookie: false, // Set this to "true" if you are having issues on IE11 or Edge
        },
        system: {	
            loggerOptions: {	
                loggerCallback: (level, message, containsPii) => {	
                    if (containsPii) {		
                        return;		
                    }		
                    switch (level) {
                        case LogLevel.Error:
                            console.error(message);
                            return;
                        case LogLevel.Info:
                            console.info(message);
                            return;
                        case LogLevel.Verbose:
                            console.debug(message);
                            return;
                        case LogLevel.Warning:
                            console.warn(message);
                            return;
                        default:
                            return;
                    }	
                }	
            }	
        }
    };
    
    /**
     * Scopes you add here will be prompted for user consent during sign-in. 
     * By default, MSAL.js will add OIDC scopes (openid, profile, email) to any login request.
     * For more information about OIDC scopes, visit: 
     * https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#openid-connect-scopes
     */
    export const loginRequest = {
        scopes: ["https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/GraphQLApi.Execute.All"]
    };
    
    /**
     * Add here the scopes to request when obtaining an access token for MS Graph API. For more information, see:
     * https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/resources-and-scopes.md
     */
    export const graphConfig = {
        graphMeEndpoint: "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
    };
   ```

   As you can see in the code above, it's important to use the correct scope to access the application. In our case `https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/GraphQLApi.Execute.All`.

3. Replace the following values with the values from the Microsoft Entra admin center.
    - `clientId` - The identifier of the application, also referred to as the client. Replace `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` with the **Application (client) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered Microsoft Entra application.
    - `authority` - This is composed of two parts:
        - The *Instance* is endpoint of the cloud provider. Check with the different available endpoints in [National clouds](/entra/identity-platform/authentication-national-cloud#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).
        - The *Tenant ID* is the identifier of the tenant where the application is registered. Replace *Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here* with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    - `graphQLEndpoint` - The Fabric API for GraphQL endpoint. Replace `Enter_the_GraphQL_Endpoint_Here` with the GraphQL API endpoint recorded earlier.
4. Save the file.
5. In the same *src* folder, open the *App.js* file and replace the contents of the file with the following code snippet:

   ```javascript
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { PageLayout } from './components/PageLayout';
    import { loginRequest, graphqlConfig } from './authConfig';
    import { ProfileData } from './components/ProfileData';
    import { AuthenticatedTemplate, UnauthenticatedTemplate, useMsal } from '@azure/msal-react';
    import './App.css';
    import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
    import Spinner from 'react-bootstrap/Spinner';
    
    /**
    * Renders information about the signed-in user or a button to retrieve data about the user
    */
    const ProfileContent = () => {
      const { instance, accounts } = useMsal();
      const [graphqlData, setGraphqlData] = useState(null);
      const [display, setDisplay] = useState(false);
    
      function RequestGraphQL() {
          // Silently acquires an access token which is then attached to a request for GraphQL data
          instance
              .acquireTokenSilent({
                  ...loginRequest,
                  account: accounts[0],
              })
              .then((response) => {
                  callGraphQL(response.accessToken).then((response) => setGraphqlData(response));
              });
      }
    
    async function callGraphQL(accessToken) {
      setDisplay(true);
      const query = `query {
        publicholidays (filter: {countryRegionCode: {eq:"US"}, date: {gte: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", lte: "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}}) {
          items {
            countryOrRegion
            holidayName
            date
          }
        }
      }`;
      fetch(graphqlConfig.graphqlEndpoint, {
              method: 'POST',
              headers: {
                  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                  'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
              },
              body: JSON.stringify({ 
                  query: query
              })
          })
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then((result) => setGraphqlData(result));
    }
    
      return (
          <>
              <h5 className="card-title">Welcome {accounts[0].name}</h5>
              <br/>
              {graphqlData ? (
                  <ProfileData graphqlData={graphqlData} />
              ) : (
                  <Button variant="primary" onClick={RequestGraphQL}>
                      Query Fabric API for GraphQL Data 
                      {display ? (
                            <Spinner
                                as="span"
                                animation="border"
                                size="sm"
                                role="status"
                                aria-hidden="true"
                            />
                        ) : null}
                  </Button>
              )}
          </>
      );
    };
    
    /**
    * If a user is authenticated the ProfileContent component above is rendered. Otherwise a message indicating a user is not authenticated is rendered.
    */
    const MainContent = () => {
      return (
          <div className="App">
              <AuthenticatedTemplate>
                  <ProfileContent />
              </AuthenticatedTemplate>
    
              <UnauthenticatedTemplate>
                  <h5>
                      <center>
                          Please sign-in to see your profile information.
                      </center>
                  </h5>
              </UnauthenticatedTemplate>
          </div>
      );
    };
    
    export default function App() {
      return (
          <PageLayout>
              <center>
                  <MainContent />
              </center>
          </PageLayout>
      );
    }
   ```

6. Save the file.

1. Finally, under the *src/components* folder, open the *ProfileData.jsx* file and replace the contents of the file with the following code snippet:

   ```javascript
    import React from "react";
    import ListGroup from 'react-bootstrap/ListGroup'; 
    import Table from 'react-bootstrap/Table';
    /**
     * Renders information about the user obtained from MS Graph 
     * @param props
     */
    export const ProfileData = (props) => {
      const holidays = props.graphqlData.data.publicholidays.items;
      return (
        <Table striped bordered hover responsive>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Country</th>
            <th>Holiday</th>
            <th>Date</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {holidays.map((item,i) => (
          <tr key={i}>
            <td>{item.countryOrRegion}</td>
            <td>{item.holidayName}</td>
            <td>{item.date}</td>
          </tr>
          ))}
          </tbody>
        </Table>
    )};
   ```

2. Save all the file changes.
3. In your terminal application of choice, go the root folder of the React project and execute the command `npm start` to test the application locally.
4. Once the application loads in your browser from `http://localhost:3000`, follow the steps on the last part of the tutorial [Call the API from the application](/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-single-page-app-react-call-api#call-the-microsoft-graph-api-from-the-application) to authenticate.
5. After signing in, click on the button **Query Fabric API for GraphQL Data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-apps-api-graphql/test-react-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the React sample app after sign in.":::

1. A successful authenticated request to the GraphQL API in Fabric returns the data from GraphQL query to the Lakehouse in our React client application:
