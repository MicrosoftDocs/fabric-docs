# Lifecycle of Apache Spark runtimes in Fabric

The Microsoft Fabric runtime is an Azure-integrated platform based on Apache Spark. It facilitates the execution and management of data engineering and data science workflows. It synthesizes essential elements from both proprietary and open-source resources to offer a comprehensive solution. For brevity, we refer to the Microsoft Fabric Runtime powered by Apache Spark simply as Fabric Runtime.

## Release cadence

Apache Spark typically releases minor versions every 6 to 9 months. The Microsoft Fabric Spark team is committed to delivering new runtime versions with alacrity while ensuring the highest quality and integration as well as continuous support. Each version comprises around 110 components. As the runtime expands beyond Apache Spark, we ensure seamless integration within the Azure ecosystem.

With a commitment to excellence, we approach new preview runtime releases carefully, targeting an experimental preview in ~3 months but ultimately establishing timelines on a case-by-case basis. This involves evaluating critical components of each Spark version, including Java, Scala, Python, R, and Delta Lake. After thorough assessment, we create a detailed timeline outlining the runtime's availability and progression through various stages. Overall, Our goal is to establish a standard lifecycle path for Microsoft Fabric runtimes for Apache Spark.

> [!TIP]
> Always use the most recent, GA runtime version for your production workload, which currently is [Runtime 1.3](./runtime-1-3.md).

The following table lists the runtime name, and release dates for supported Azure Synapse runtime releases.

| Runtime name                                               | Release stage | End of Support date |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| [Runtime 1.3 based on Apache Spark 3.5](./runtime-1-3.md) | GA            | September 30, 2026  |
| [Runtime 1.2 based on Apache Spark 3.4](./runtime-1-2.md) | GA            | March 31, 2026      |
| [Runtime 1.1 based on Apache Spark 3.3](./runtime-1-1.md) | EOS         | March 31, 2025      |

| Experimental public preview                             | The Experimental public preview phase marks the initial release of a new runtime version. During this phase, users are urged to experiment with the latest versions of Apache Spark and Delta Lake and provide feedback, despite the presence of documented limitations. The Microsoft Azure Preview terms apply. See [Preview Terms Of Use](../fundamentals/preview.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2-3 months*                               |
| Public preview                                          | After further improvements are made and limitations are minimalized, the runtime progresses to the preview stage. The Microsoft Azure Preview terms apply. See [Preview Terms Of Use](../fundamentals/preview.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 3 months*                                 |
| General Availability (GA)                               | Once a runtime version meets the General Availability (GA) criteria, it's released to the public and is suitable for production workloads. To reach this stage, the runtime must meet strict requirements in terms of performance, integration with the platform, reliability assessments, and its ability to meet users' needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 24 months                                |
| Long Term Support (LTS)                                 | Following the General Availability (GA) release, a runtime may transition into the Long-Term Support (LTS) stage, depending on the specific requirements of the Spark version. This LTS stage may be announced, detailing the expected support duration for customers, which is generally an additional year of full support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 12 months*                                |
| End of support date announced                           | When a runtime reaches its end of support, it will not receive any further updates or support. Typically, a six-month notice is given before the deprecation of the runtime. This end-of-support date is documented by updating a specific table with the end-of-life date, which marks the discontinuation of support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 6 months before deprecation day          |
| End of support date. Runtime Unsupported and Deprecated | Once the previously announced end-of-support date arrives, the runtime becomes officially unsupported. This implies that it will not receive any updates or bug fixes, and no official support will be provided by the team. All support tickets will be automatically resolved. Using an unsupported runtime is at the user's own risk. The runtime will be removed from Fabric workspace settings and Environment item, making it impossible to use at the workspace level. Furthermore, the runtime will also be removed from the environments, and there will be no option to create a new environment for that supported runtime version. Existing Spark Jobs running on the existing environments will be unable to execute. | N/A                                      |
| Runtime removed                                         | Once the runtime reaches the unsupported phase, all environments using this runtime are eliminated. All backend-related components associated with this runtime are also removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A few days after the end of support date |

## Versioning

Our runtime version numbering, while closely related to Semantic Versioning, follows a slightly different approach. The
runtime major version corresponds to the Apache Spark major version. Therefore, Runtime 1 corresponds to Spark version 3. Similarly, the upcoming Runtime 2 will align with Spark 4.0. It's essential to note that between the current runtimes, changes may occur, including the addition or removal of different libraries. Additionally, our platform offers [a library management feature](./library-management.md) that empowers users to install any desired libraries.
