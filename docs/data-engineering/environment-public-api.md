# Manage the environment through public APIs

The Microsoft Fabric REST API provides a service endpoint for the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations of a Fabric item. This article describes the available environment REST APIs and their usage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new release includes new APIs, API deprecations, and changes of API response/request contract. The table in the following section summarizes all API changes.

## Environment public API update details

This section describes the upcoming updates for existing APIs.

### Get Environment

In the response of the Get Environment API, `startTime` changes to `startDateTime` and `endTime` changes to `endDateTime`. The properties represent the start and end times of the publish operation.

> [!NOTE]
> The `startTime` and `endTime` properties use the *Date-Time* format. The `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` properties change to `String`, which is in UTC and uses the *YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ* format.

### Publish environment

The Publish Environment API supports long-running operations starting from the release, but the response contract changes. The endpoint remains the same for sending requests.

- Interface

    ```HTTP
    POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/environments/{environmentId}/staging/publish
    ```

- Original sample response

## Environment public API use cases

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new APIs and contract changes aren't included in this section.

This section demonstrates how to use the currently available APIs to achieve specific goals. You can replace the `{WORKSPACE_ID}` and `{ARTIFACT_ID}` properties in the following examples with appropriate values.

### Create a new environment

To create a new empty environment, use the following API.

- Sample request

    ```http
    POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments

    {
        "displayName": "Environment_1",
        "description": "An environment description"
    }
    ```

### Manage staging libraries

You can use the upload and delete staging libraries APIs to manage the library section in the environment.

#### Check the published libraries for the environment

Before you add or delete a library, use the Get Published Libraries API to check which libraries are currently effective.

- Sample request

    ```http
    GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/libraries
    ```

- Sample response

    ```http
    {
        "customLibraries": {
            "wheelFiles": [
                "samplewheel-0.18.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl"
            ],
            "pyFiles": [
                "samplepython.py"
            ],
            "jarFiles": [
                "samplejar.jar"
            ],
            "rTarFiles": [
                "sampleR.tar.gz"
            ]
        },
        "environmentYml": "dependencies:\r\n- pip:\r\n  - matplotlib==3.4.3"
    }
    ```

#### Upload the libraries

The API for uploading staging libraries accepts one file at a time. The supported file types are *.whl*, *.jar*, *.tar.gz*, *.py*, and *environment.yml* for public libraries. You can specify the file via the multipart/form-data content type.

> [!NOTE]
> To manipulate the public library more efficiently, we recommend that you compose all the expected libraries from PyPI and Conda in an *environment.yml* file.
>
>The uploading API allows up to a 200-MB file in one request. A library that exceeds this size limit currently isn't supported in public APIs.

- Sample requests

    ```http
    POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/staging/libraries
    ```

#### Delete the libraries

By specifying the full library file name with the type suffix, you can delete one library at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify *environment.yml* as the file to delete, you remove all public libraries.
>
> If you want to remove a subset of an existing public library, use [upload library](environment-public-api.md#upload-the-libraries) instead and upload an *environment.yml* file that contains only the expected libraries. The uploaded *environment.yml* file replaces the existing public library section entirely.

- Sample requests

    ```http
    DELETE https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/staging/libraries?libraryToDelete=fuzzywuzzy-0.18.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    ```

### Manage staging Spark compute

You can use the update staging Spark compute to manage the Spark compute.

#### Check the published Spark compute for the environment

Before you change the configurations for the environment, use the Get Published Spark Compute API to check what Spark compute configurations are currently effective.

- Sample request

    ```http
    GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/sparkcompute
    ```

- Sample response

    ```http
    {
        "instancePool": {
            "name": "Starter Pool",
            "type": "Workspace"
        },
        "driverCores": 4,
        "driverMemory": "56g",
        "executorCores": 4,
        "executorMemory": "56g",
        "dynamicExecutorAllocation": {
            "enabled": false,
            "minExecutors": 1,
            "maxExecutors": 1
        },
        "sparkProperties": {
            "spark.acls.enable": "false"
        },
        "runtimeVersion": "1.2"
    }
    ```

#### Update the compute configurations

You can update the Spark runtime, switch to another pool, refine compute configuration, and add or remove Spark properties through editing the request body of this API.

You can switch the attached pool by specifying the pool name and pool. Specify the pool name as `Starter Pool` to switch the pool to default settings. To get the full list of the available custom pools of the workspace by REST API, see [Custom Pools - List Workspace Custom Pools](/rest/api/fabric/spark/custom-pools/list-workspace-custom-pools).

If you want to remove an existing Spark property, specify the value as `null` with the key that you want to remove.

- Sample request

    ```http
    PATCH https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/staging/sparkcompute

    {
        "instancePool": {
            "name": "Starter Pool",
            "type": "Workspace"
        },
        "driverCores": 4,
        "driverMemory": "56g",
        "executorCores": 4,
        "executorMemory": "56g",
        "dynamicExecutorAllocation": {
            "enabled": false,
            "minExecutors": 1,
            "maxExecutors": 1
        },
        "sparkProperties": {
            "spark.acls.enable": null
        },
        "runtimeVersion": "1.2"
    }
    ```

### Make the changes effective

Use the following sets of APIs to publish the changes.

#### Prepare for a publish operation

The environment can accept one publish operation at a time. Before you publish your environment, validate the status of the environment and have a final review of the staging changes. After the environment is published successfully, all configurations in the staging state become effective.

- **Step 1:** Get the metadata of the environment.

    ```http
    GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/
    ```

    In the response body, you can clearly tell the state of the environment. Make sure that no publish operation is ongoing before you move to the next step.

- **Step 2:** Get the staging libraries/Spark compute to have a final review.

    ```http
    GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/staging/libraries
    
    GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/environments/{{ARTIFACT_ID}}/staging/sparkcompute
    ```

#### Trigger the publish operation of the environment

The changes that you made for the staging libraries and Spark compute are cached, but they require publishing to become effective. Use the next example to trigger the publish operation.

- Sample request

    ```http
