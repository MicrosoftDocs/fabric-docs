# Lakehouse tutorial: Create a Fabric workspace

Before you can begin creating the lakehouse, you need to create a workspace where you can build out the remainder of the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Sign up for the free [Microsoft Fabric trial](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md). The Fabric trial requires a Power BI license. If you don't have one, [sign up for a Fabric free license,](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/?pbi_source=learn-data-engineering-tutorial-lakehouse-get-started) and then you can start the Fabric trial.
