# Indexing in Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric (preview)

[!INCLUDE[Feature preview note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

Cosmos DB is a schema-agnostic database that allows you to iterate on your application without having to deal with schema or index management. Indexing within Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric is designed to deliver fast and flexible query performance, no matter how your data evolves. By default, Cosmos DB automatically indexes every property for all items in your container without having to define any schema or configure secondary indexes.

## Conceptual tree

Every time an item is stored in a container, its content is projected as a JSON document, then converted into a tree representation. This conversion means that every property of that item gets represented as a node in a tree. A pseudo root node is created as a parent to all the first-level properties of the item. The leaf nodes contain the actual scalar values carried by an item.

As an example, consider this item:

```json
{
  "locations": [
    { "country": "Germany", "city": "Berlin" },
    { "country": "France", "city": "Paris" }
  ],
  "headquarters": { "country": "Belgium", "employees": 250 },
  "exports": [
    { "city": "Moscow" },
    { "city": "Athens" }
  ]
}
```

This conceptual tree represents the sample JSON item:

- *`locations`*
  - `0`
    - *`country`*: `Germany`
    - *`city`*: `Berlin`
  - `1`
    - *`country`*: `France`
    - *`city`*: `Paris`
- *`headquarters`*
  - *`country`*: `Belgium`
  - *`employees`*: `250`
- *`exports`*
  - `0`
    - *`city`*: `Moscow`
  - `1`
    - *`city`*: `Athens`

:::image type="complex" source="media/indexing/tree.png" alt-text="Diagram of the tree representation of an item in Cosmos DB.":::
  A tree diagram showing a root node with three branches: "locations", "headquarters," and "exports." "Locations" splits into two numbered nodes, each with two location-related subnodes ("Germany or Berlin" and "France or Paris"). "Headquarters" has "Belgium" for its location and "employees" ("250"). "Exports" splits into two numbered nodes, each with a "city" subnode ("Moscow" and "Athens").
:::image-end:::

Pay attention to how arrays are encoded in the tree: every entry in an array gets an intermediate node labeled with the index of that entry within the array. For example, the first entry is `0` and the second entry is `1`.

## Property paths

Cosmos DB transforms items into trees because it allows the system to reference properties using their paths within those trees. To get the path for a property, we can traverse the tree from the root node to that property, and concatenate the labels of each traversed node.

Here are the paths for each property from the example item described previously:

| Path | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `/locations/0/country` | `"Germany"` |
| `/locations/0/city` | `"Berlin"` |
| `/locations/1/country` | `"France"` |
| `/locations/1/city` | `"Paris"` |
| `/headquarters/country` | `"Belgium"` |
| `/headquarters/employees` | `250` |
| `/exports/0/city` | `"Moscow"` |
| `/exports/1/city` | `"Athens"` |

Cosmos DB effectively indexes each property's path and its corresponding value when an item is written.

## Index types

Cosmos DB currently supports four types of indexes. 

- [Range](#range-index)
- [Spatial](#spatial-index)
- [Composite](#composite-index)
- [Vector](#vector-index)

You can configure these index types when defining the indexing policy.

### Range index

**Range** indexes are based on an ordered tree-like structure. The range index type is used for:

- Equality queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      c.property = 'value'
    ```

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      c.property IN ("value1", "value2", "value3")
    ```

- Equality match on an array element

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      ARRAY_CONTAINS(c.tags, "tag1")
    ```

- Range queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      c.property > 0
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Works for `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`

- Checking for the presence of a property:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      IS_DEFINED(c.property)
    ```

- String system functions:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      CONTAINS(c.property, "value")
    ```

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      STRINGEQUALS(c.property, "value")
    ```

- `ORDER BY` queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    ORDER BY
      c.property
    ```

- `JOIN` queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      d
    FROM
      container c
    JOIN
      d IN c.properties
    WHERE
      d = 'value'
    ```

Range indexes can be used on scalar values (string or number). The default indexing policy for newly created containers enforces range indexes for any string or number.

> [!NOTE]
> An `ORDER BY` clause that orders by a single property *always* needs a range index and fails if the path it references doesn't have one. Similarly, an `ORDER BY` query that orders by multiple properties *always* needs a composite index.

### Spatial index

**Spatial** indexes enable efficient queries on geospatial objects such as points, lines, polygons, and multipolygons. These queries use `ST_DISTANCE`, `ST_WITHIN`, `ST_INTERSECTS` keywords. The following are some examples that use spatial index type:

- Geospatial distance queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      ST_DISTANCE(c.property, { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.0, 10.0] }) < 40
    ```

- Geospatial within queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      ST_WITHIN(c.property, {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.0, 10.0] })
    ```

- Geospatial intersect queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      ST_INTERSECTS(c.property, { 'type':'Polygon', 'coordinates': [[ [31.8, -5], [32, -5], [31.8, -5] ]]  })  
    ```

Spatial indexes can be used on correctly formatted [GeoJSON](indexing-policies.md#spatial-indexes) objects. Points, LineStrings, Polygons, and MultiPolygons are currently supported.

### Composite index

**Composite** indexes increase the efficiency when you're performing operations on multiple fields. The composite index type is used for:

- `ORDER BY` queries on multiple properties:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    ORDER BY
      c.property1,
      c.property2
    ```

- Queries with a filter and `ORDER BY`. These queries can utilize a composite index if the filter property is added to the `ORDER BY` clause.

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      c.property1 = 'value'
    ORDER BY
      c.property1,
      c.property2
    ```

- Queries with a filter on two or more properties where at least one property is an equality filter:

    ```nosql
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      c.property1 = 'value' AND
      c.property2 > 'value'
    ```

As long as one filter predicate uses one of the index types, the query engine evaluates that first before scanning the rest. For example, if you have a SQL query such as `SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.department = "Information Technology" and CONTAINS(c.team, "Pilot")`:

- This query first applies a filter for entries where `department = "Information Technology"` by using the index. It then passes all of the `department = "Information Technology"` entries through a subsequent pipeline to evaluate the `CONTAINS` filter predicate.

- You can speed up queries and avoid full container scans when using functions that perform a full scan like `CONTAINS`. You can add more filter predicates that use the index to speed up these queries. The order of filter clauses isn't important. The query engine figures out which predicates are more selective and run the query accordingly.

### Vector index

**Vector** indexes increase the efficiency when performing vector searches using the `VECTORDISTANCE` system function. Vector searches have lower latency, higher throughput, and less RU consumption when using a vector index. Cosmos DB supports any vector embeddings (text, image, multimodal, etc.) under 4,096 dimensions in size.

- `ORDER BY` vector search queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT TOP 10
      *
    FROM
      container c
    ORDER BY
      VECTORDISTANCE(c.vector1, c.vector2)
    ```

- Projection of the similarity score in vector search queries:

    ```nosql
    SELECT TOP 10
      c.name,
      VECTORDISTANCE(c.vector1, c.vector2) AS score
    FROM
      container c
    ORDER BY
      VECTORDISTANCE(c.vector1, c.vector2)
    ```

- Range filters on the similarity score.

    ```nosql
    SELECT TOP 10
      *
    FROM
      container c
    WHERE
      VECTORDISTANCE(c.vector1, c.vector2) > 0.8
    ORDER BY
      VECTORDISTANCE(c.vector1, c.vector2)
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Vector policies and vector indexes are immutable after creation. To make changes, create a new collection.

## Index usage

There are five ways that the query engine can evaluate query filters, sorted by most-efficient to least-efficient:

- Index seek
- Precise index scan
- Expanded index scan
- Full index scan
- Full scan

When you index property paths, the query engine automatically uses the index as efficiently as possible. Aside from indexing new property paths, you don't need to configure anything to optimize how queries use the index. A query's RU charge is a combination of both the RU charge from index usage and the RU charge from loading items.

The following table summarizes the different ways indexes are used in Cosmos DB:

| Lookup type | Description | Common examples | Charge from index usage | Charges from loading items from transactional data store |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Index seek** | Read only required indexed values and load only matching items from the transactional data store | Equality filters, IN | Constant per equality filter | Increases based on number of items in query results |
| **Precise index scan** | Binary search of indexed values and load only matching items from the transactional data store | Range comparisons (>, <, <=, or >=), StartsWith | Comparable to index seek, increases slightly based on the cardinality of indexed properties | Increases based on number of items in query results |
| **Expanded index scan** | Optimized search (but less efficient than a binary search) of indexed values and load only matching items from the transactional data store | StartsWith (case-insensitive), StringEquals (case-insensitive) | Increases slightly based on the cardinality of indexed properties | Increases based on number of items in query results |
| **Full index scan** | Read distinct set of indexed values and load only matching items from the transactional data store | Contains, EndsWith, RegexMatch, LIKE | Increases linearly based on the cardinality of indexed properties | Increases based on number of items in query results |
| **Full scan** | Load all items from the transactional data store | Upper, Lower | N/A | Increases based on number of items in container |

When writing queries, you should use filter predicates that use the index as efficiently as possible. For example, if either `StartsWith` or `Contains` would work for your use case, you should opt for `StartsWith` since it does a precise index scan instead of a full index scan.

## Index usage details

> [!TIP]
> This section covers more details about how queries use indexes. This level of detail isn't necessary to learn how to get started with Cosmos DB but is documented in detail for curious users. We reference the example item shared earlier in this document:

Consider these two example items:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "locations": [
      { "country": "Germany", "city": "Berlin" },
      { "country": "France", "city": "Paris" }
    ],
    "headquarters": { "country": "Belgium", "employees": 250 },
    "exports": [
      { "city": "Moscow" },
      { "city": "Athens" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "locations": [
      { "country": "Ireland", "city": "Dublin" }
    ],
    "headquarters": { "country": "Belgium", "employees": 200 },
    "exports": [
      { "city": "Moscow" },
      { "city": "Athens" },
      { "city": "London" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Cosmos DB uses an inverted index. The index works by mapping each JSON path to the set of items that contain that value. The item ID mapping is represented across many different index pages for the container. Here's a sample diagram of an inverted index for a container that includes the two example items:

| Path | Value | List of item identifiers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/locations/0/country` | `Germany` | `[1]` |
| `/locations/0/country` | `Ireland` | `[2]` |
| `/locations/0/city` | `Berlin` | `[1]` |
| `/locations/0/city` | `Dublin` | `[2]` |
| `/locations/1/country` | `France` | `[1]` |
| `/locations/1/city` | `Paris` | `[1]` |
| `/headquarters/country` | `Belgium` | `[1, 2]` |
| `/headquarters/employees` | `200` | `[2]` |
| `/headquarters/employees` | `250` | `[1]` |

The inverted index has two important attributes:

- For a given path, values are sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the query engine can easily serve `ORDER BY` from the index.

- For a given path, the query engine can scan through the distinct set of possible values to identify the index pages where there are results.

The query engine can utilize the inverted index in four different ways:

### Index seek

Consider the following query:

```nosql
SELECT
  location
FROM
  location IN company.locations
WHERE
  location.country = 'France'
```

The query predicate (filtering on items where any location has "France" as its region) would match the path called out here:

- *`locations`*
  - `1`
    - *`country`*: `France`

:::image type="complex" source="media/indexing/matching-path.png" alt-text="Diagram of a traversal (search) matching a specific path within a tree representation of an item in Cosmos DB.":::
  A tree diagram showing a root node with three branches: "locations", "headquarters," and "exports." "Locations" splits into two numbered nodes, each with two location-related subnodes ("Germany/Berlin" and "France/Paris"). "Headquarters" has "Belgium" for its location and "employees" ("250"). "Exports" splits into two numbered nodes, each with a "city" subnode ("Moscow" and "Athens"). The path for "locations," "1," location, and "France" are highlighted.
:::image-end:::

Since this query has an equality filter, after traversing this tree, we can quickly identify the index pages that contain the query results. In this case, the query engine would read index pages that contain Item 1. An index seek is the most efficient way to use the index. With an index seek, we only read the necessary index pages and load only the items in the query results. Therefore, the index lookup time and RU charge from index lookup are incredibly low, regardless of the total data volume.

### Precise index scan

Consider the following query:

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  company
WHERE
  company.headquarters.employees > 200
```

The query predicate (filtering on items where there are more than 200 employees) can be evaluated with a precise index scan of the `headquarters/employees` path. When doing a precise index scan, the query engine starts by doing a binary search of the distinct set of possible values to find the location of the value `200` for the `headquarters/employees` path. Since the values for each path are sorted in ascending order, it's easy for the query engine to do a binary search. After the query engine finds the value `200`, it starts reading all remaining index pages (going in the ascending direction).

Because the query engine can do a binary search to avoid scanning unnecessary index pages, precise index scans tend to have comparable latency and RU charges to index seek operations.

### Expanded index scan

Consider the following query:

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  company
WHERE
  STARTSWITH(company.headquarters.country, "United", true)
```

The query predicate (filtering on items that have headquarters in a location that starts with case-insensitive "United") can be evaluated with an expanded index scan of the `headquarters/country` path. Operations that do an expanded index scan have optimizations that can help avoid needs to scan every index page but are slightly more expensive than a precise index scan's binary search.

For example, when evaluating case-insensitive `StartsWith`, the query engine checks the index for different possible combinations of uppercase and lowercase values. This optimization allows the query engine to avoid reading most index pages. Different system functions have different optimizations that they can use to avoid reading every index page, so they're broadly categorized as expanded index scan.

### Full index scan

Consider the following query:

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  company
WHERE
  CONTAINS(company.headquarters.country, "United")
```

The query predicate (filtering on items that have headquarters in a location that contains "United") can be evaluated with an index scan of the `headquarters/country` path. Unlike a precise index scan, a full index scan always scans through the distinct set of possible values to identify the index pages where there are results. In this case, `CONTAINS` is run on the index. The index lookup time and RU charge for index scans increases as the cardinality of the path increases. In other words, the more possible distinct values that the query engine needs to scan, the higher the latency and RU charge involved in doing a full index scan.  

For example, consider two properties: `town` and `country`. The cardinality of town is 5,000 and the cardinality of `country` is 200. Here are two example queries that each have a [`CONTAINS`](/nosql/query/contains) system function that does a full index scan on the `town` property. The first query uses more request units (RUs) than the second query because the cardinality of town is higher than `country`.

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  container c
WHERE
 CONTAINS(c.town, "Red", false)
```

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  c
WHERE
  CONTAINS(c.country, "States", false)
```

### Full scan

In some cases, the query engine might not be able to evaluate a query filter using the index. In this case, the query engine needs to load all items from the transactional store in order to evaluate the query filter. Full scans don't use the index and have an RU charge that increases linearly with the total data size. Luckily, operations that require full scans are rare.

#### Vector search queries without a defined vector index

If you don't define a vector index policy and use the `VECTORDISTANCE` system function in an `ORDER BY` clause, then this query results in a full scan and have an RU charge higher than if you defined a vector index policy. Similarity, if you use `VECTORDISTANCE` with the brute force boolean value set to *true*, and don't have a `flat` index defined for the vector path, then a full scan occurs.

### Queries with complex filter expressions

In the earlier examples, we only considered queries that had simple filter expressions (for example, queries with just a single equality or range filter). In reality, most queries have much more complex filter expressions.

Consider the following query:

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  company
WHERE
  company.headquarters.employees = 200 AND CONTAINS(company.headquarters.country, "United")
```

To execute this query, the query engine must do an index seek on `headquarters/employees` and full index scan on `headquarters/country`. The query engine has internal heuristics that it uses to evaluate the query filter expression as efficiently as possible. In this case, the query engine would avoid needing to read unnecessary index pages by doing the index seek first. If for example, only 50 items matched the equality filter, the query engine would only need to evaluate `CONTAINS` on the index pages that contained those 50 items. A full index scan of the entire container wouldn't be necessary.

## Index utilization for scalar aggregate functions

Queries with aggregate functions must rely exclusively on the index in order to use it.

In some cases, the index can return false positives. For example, when evaluating `CONTAINS` on the index, the number of matches in the index might exceed the number of query results. The query engine loads all index matches, evaluates the filter on the loaded items, and returns only the correct results.

For most queries, loading false positive index matches doesn't have any noticeable effect on index utilization.

For example, consider the following query:

```nosql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  company
WHERE
  CONTAINS(company.headquarters.country, "United")
```

The `CONTAINS` system function might return some false positive matches, so the query engine needs to verify whether each loaded item matches the filter expression. In this example, the query engine might only need to load an extra few items, so the effect on index utilization and RU charge is minimal.

However, queries with aggregate functions must rely exclusively on the index in order to use it. For example, consider the following query with a `COUNT` aggregate:

```nosql
SELECT
  COUNT(1)
FROM
  company
WHERE
  CONTAINS(company.headquarters.country, "United")
```

Like in the first example, the `CONTAINS` system function might return some false positive matches. Unlike the `SELECT *` query, however, the `COUNT` query can't evaluate the filter expression on the loaded items to verify all index matches. The `COUNT` query must rely exclusively on the index, so if there's a chance a filter expression returns false positive matches, the query engine resorts to a full scan.

Queries with the following aggregate functions must rely exclusively on the index, so evaluating some system functions requires a full scan.

- [`AVG`](/nosql/query/avg)
- [`COUNT`](/nosql/query/count)
- [`MAX`](/nosql/query/max)
- [`MIN`](/nosql/query/min)
- [`SUM`](/nosql/query/sum)
