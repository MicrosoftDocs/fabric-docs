# Limitations in Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric (preview)

[!INCLUDE[Feature preview note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

This article lists current limitations for Cosmos DB in Fabric.

**The content in this article changes regularly. For the latest limitations, revisit this article periodically.**

## Quotas and limits

- Databases support a maximum of **25** containers.

- Databases support a maximum of **10,000** request units per second (RU/s).

## Regional availability

- The following regions aren't* supported as **capacity** regions during the preview. These regions can be selected as your **home** region, but the paired **capacity** region must be selected from a supported region not included in this list:

  - West US 3

  - Central US

  - South Central US

  - Switzerland North

## Data

- JSON strings greater than **8 kB** are truncated when queried from the mirrored SQL analytics endpoint. The query editor includes the following error message:

  ```output
  JSON text is not properly formatted. Unexpected character '"' is found at position  
  ```

  - This limitation is related to a similar limitation of the data warehouse feature. The current workaround is to create a shortcut of the mirrored database in Fabric Lakehouse and utilize a Spark notebook to query your data.

## Vector search

- `quantizedFlat` and `diskANN` indexes require at least 1,000 vectors to be indexed to ensure that the quantization is accurate. If fewer than 1,000 vectors are indexed, then a full-scan is used instead and RU charges might be higher.

- Vectors indexed with the `flat` index type can be at most 505 dimensions. Vectors indexed with the `quantizedFlat` or `DiskANN` index type can be at most 4,096 dimensions.

- The rate of vector insertions should be limited. Large ingestion, in excess of 5,000,000 vectors, could require extra index build time.

- The vector search feature isn't currently supported on the existing containers. To use it, a new container must be created, and the container-level vector embedding policy must be specified.

- Shared throughput databases are unsupported.

- At this time, vector indexing and vector search aren't supported on accounts with Analytical Store, Azure Synapse Link, or shared throughput.

- Once vector indexing and vector search are enabled on a container, they can't be disabled.

## Full text indexing

- Multi-language support is only supported with the following languages:

  - `en-US` (English)
  
  - `de-DE` (German)
  
  - `es-ES` (Spanish)
  
  - `fr-FR` (French)

## Authorization

- Setting Fabric [item permissions](../../security/permission-model.md#item-permissions) is currently not supported.

## Configuration

- Modifying the throughput of an existing container isn't supported.

## Programmability

- Stored procedures, triggers, or user-defined functions aren't supported.
