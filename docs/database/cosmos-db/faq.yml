      - question: |
          What is Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Fabric is an enterprise-ready, end-to-end data platform. Fabric unifies data movement, databases, data engineering, data science, real-time intelligence, BI with copilot, and application development. You no longer need to put together these services individually from multiple vendors.

          Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric is an AI-optimized NoSQL database, automatically configured to meet your application needs through a simplified experience. Developers can use Cosmos DB in Fabric to build AI applications with ease, without managing complex database settings. Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric is based on [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql), which provides dynamic scaling, high availability, and reliability for the database.

          Cosmos DB is a new addition to the Databases workload in Fabric. You can now store semi-structured NoSQL data in Cosmos DB in Fabric. Semi-structured data can be stored alongside your relational data in SQL databases in Fabric, enabling a unified data platform for your applications.

          Cosmos DB data is made available to Fabric OneLake automatically. This integration provides deep integration of Cosmos DB with the rest of Fabric platform, enabling seamless analytics, Real-time intelligence, User Data Functions (UDFs), GraphQL, Data Science and BI with Copilot, and data agents all in one place.

          For more information, see [Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric](overview.md).
      - question: |
          How do I connect to Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Fabric exposes an endpoint that is compatible with the various Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL software development kits (SDKs). These SDKs along with the corresponding Azure Identity library should be used to connect to the database directly using Microsoft Entra authentication. For more information, see [connect to Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric using Microsoft Entra ID](how-to-authenticate.md).
      - question: |
          What query language can I use to query data in Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric primarily supports the NoSQL query language for querying data.

          The NoSQL query language provides a powerful, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Structured Query Language (SQL)-like syntax for working with JSON data. This language is designed to be familiar to users with SQL experience, while also supporting the flexibility and hierarchical nature of JSON documents.

          The built-in mirroring feature for Cosmos DB in Fabric also supports the use of T-SQL to query data. Mirroring and the SQL analytics endpoint allow you to use familiar T-SQL syntax to work with your Cosmos DB data, making it easier to integrate with existing SQL-based workflows and tools.

          For more information, see [use the NoSQL query language](/nosql/query).
      - question: |
          How can I secure my data in Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric provides several security features to help protect your data by default. These features include, but aren't limited to:

          - Microsoft Entra authentication for secure access
          - Data encryption at rest and in transit

          You can also enhance security by implementing more measures, such as:

          - Customer-managed keys for encryption at rest
          - Network isolation and private endpoints

          For more information, see [security for Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric](security.md).

    questions:
      - question: |
          Why is Cosmos DB isn't available as an option when I select Fabric => Workspaces => New Item?
        answer: |
          By default, preview features aren't enabled in your Fabric workspace. To enable Cosmos DB in Fabric, use the Admin portal's tenant settings to enable the Cosmos DB (../../includes/feature-preview-note.md
          For more information, see, [tenant settings](../../admin/about-tenant-settings.md#how-to-get-to-the-tenant-settings).

          If you can't enable the feature, ensure that your current role has the necessary permissions to modify tenant settings.

          For more information, see [roles required to enable previews](../../fundamentals/preview.md#who-can-enable-a-preview-experiences-and-features).
      - question: |
          How do I control which users in my organization can access the Cosmos DB feature in Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          You can control access to the Cosmos DB feature in Microsoft Fabric by managing user roles and permissions through the Admin portal. Grant users access to the feature by assigning the appropriate roles to users or security groups.

          For more information, see [tenant settings](../../admin/about-tenant-settings.md#how-to-use-the-tenant-settings).
