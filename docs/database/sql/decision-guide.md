# Microsoft Fabric decision guide: choose a SQL database

Use this reference guide and the example scenarios to help you choose the most suitable operational database for your transactional workloads: **Azure SQL Database** or a **SQL database in Fabric** (preview).

Both provide all the enterprise-scale features and capabilities of the SQL Database Engine, with all the familiar performance of cloud-scale operational database. With **Azure SQL Database** you retain detailed control of the provisioning of your databases, while **SQL database in Fabric** (preview) provides autonomous management and ease of use advantages. **SQL database in Fabric** is fully integrated with other workloads in the Microsoft Fabric platform by default.

## Databases

For a detailed comparison of features and capabilities, see [Features comparison: Azure SQL Database and SQL database in Fabric (preview)](feature-comparison-sql-database-fabric.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SQL databases in Fabric are currently in PREVIEW. Features and capabilities are likely to expand.

## Scenarios

Review these scenarios for help with choosing a data store in Fabric.

### Scenario 1

Kirby is a solutions architect creating an AI application for operational data. They need an easy-to-manage operational database platform that can easily integrate with cross-platform queries against real-time intelligence data, parquet files, and master data managed in a warehouse.

Kirby chooses a SQL database in Fabric for operational data. The serverless, autoscaling architecture of a SQL database provides cost-effective resources on-demand. Thanks to mirroring to the Fabric OneLake, data in the SQL database is automatically available to other workloads inside Fabric. The multi-model capabilities of SQL database, based on the rock-solid SQL Database Engine of SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, provides relational, graph, JSON, and key-value data architectures.

The simple, autonomous, and integrated nature of default configurations of SQL database in Fabric minimizes database management tasks, with best practices already implemented.

SQL database in Fabric is simple to purchase as well - the features of SQL database in Fabric are the same at any Fabric capacity.

### Scenario 2

Arin is an Azure architect experienced working with .NET application developers at an independent software vendor (ISV). They're developing a new transactional database with large scale in mind: 10+ TB of data is expected, and the workload requires high memory/vCore ratios.

Arin chooses [Azure SQL Database Hyperscale](/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tier-hyperscale?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true) with premium series memory-optimized provisioned hardware. Hyperscale provides the highest possible Azure SQL Database storage capacity, up to 128 TB of storage. [Hyperscale is built on a distinct cloud-native architecture](/azure/azure-sql/database/hyperscale-architecture?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true) that provides independently scalable compute and storage. The premium-series memory optimized hardware provides 10.2 GB of provisioned memory per vCore for up to 128 vCores, higher than other available Azure SQL Database hardware.
