# Use SQL database as the source for translytical applications

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-sqldb](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric-sqldb.md)]

This article describes how to use SQL database in Microsoft Fabric as the operational backbone for translytical apps - apps that require both transactional and analytical access to the same data.

The goal is to enable transactional workloads, operational APIs, and immediate analytical data in a single database, within the governed, secure **Microsoft Fabric** platform.

## SQL analytics endpoint

When you create a SQL database in Fabric, the data is automatically replicated in near real time into OneLake, creating a read-only copy of your data in Delta tables that are accessible via T-SQL through the [SQL analytics endpoint](sql-analytics-endpoint.md). This architecture means that data generated by the transactional system is available for analytic queries without any processing or complex ETL pipelines. By using the SQL analytics endpoint, you can analyze data in near real time without impacting your transactional workload. This data can be used for Power BI reporting, machine learning models, or other analytics within Microsoft Fabric. The SQL analytics endpoint is also accessible to external applications that need analytical access to the data. 

Examples include:

- **Healthcare:** Monitor health metrics to provide real-time insights for healthcare professionals.
- **Finance:** Analyze market data to optimize trading strategies in real-time.
- **Retail:** Analyze customer behavior to provide personalized shopping experiences.
- **Manufacturing:** Monitor production processes to enhance product quality.

## Translytical task flows

When you use Power BI to analyze data, there might be times when you need to take action on the data such as updating a record, adding annotations, or triggering an action in another system based on the data. You can easily accomplish these tasks by using [translytical task flows](/power-bi/create-reports/translytical-task-flow-overview) in Microsoft Fabric.

Translytical task flows work by using [user data functions in Fabric](../../data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview.md) to invoke functions on the underlying Microsoft Fabric data sources. They enable scenarios such as:

- **Add data:** Add a record of data to a table in your database and see it reflected in your report. For example, adding a new customer record.
- **Edit data:** Edit an existing record of data in a table in your database and see it reflected in your report. For example, updating a status field or an annotation.
- **Delete data:** Delete an existing record of data from a table in your database and see it removed from your report. For example, removing a customer record that's no longer needed.
- **Call an external API:** Make an API request that's accessible through a network request. For example, making a request to the REST endpoint of a public API that either updates the underlying data or end user's input, or takes action in a different system.
