  - name: About SQL database data in OneLake
    questions:

      - question: |
           Is there a staging or landing zone for SQL database data replication into OneLake? If so, is it outside of OneLake? 
        answer: 
          For the data replicated into OneLake, a landing zone stores both the snapshot and change data, to improve performance when converting files into delta verti-parquet.

      - question: |
          How long does it take to replicate inserts/updates/deletes into OneLake? 
        answer: 
          Near real-time latency.

      - question: |
          Do you support replicating of views, transient or external tables into the OneLake?
        answer: 
          No. Currently, only replicating regular tables are supported.

      - question: |
          Can Power BI reports on SQL database in Fabric use direct lake mode?
        answer: 
          Yes. In OneLake, the SQL database tables are all v-ordered delta tables.

      - question: |
          How do I know Fabric is replicating data from SQL database to OneLake? 
        answer: |
           Use the following database level checks using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and stored procedures to validate configuration. [Contact support](/power-bi/support/service-support-options) if troubleshooting is required.
           1. Execute the following query to check if the changes properly flow: 
              ```sql
              SELECT * FROM sys.dm_change_feed_log_scan_sessions;
              ```
           1. If the `sys.dm_change_feed_log_scan_sessions` DMV doesn't show any progress on processing incremental changes, execute the following T-SQL query to check if there are any problems reported:
              ```sql
              SELECT * FROM sys.dm_change_feed_errors;
              ```

      - question: |
          How to stop/disable replication of data from SQL database in Fabric to OneLake?

          For SQL database in Fabric, the replication of data to OneLake can't be disabled. 

      - question: | 
          Are system objects such as system views and dynamic management views the same as Fabric database mirroring?
