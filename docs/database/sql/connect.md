# Connect to your SQL database in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-sqldb](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric-sqldb.md)]

You can connect to and query your [SQL database in Fabric](overview.md) in all the same ways as [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview?view=azuresqldb-current&preserve-view=true).

## Prerequisites

- You need an existing Fabric capacity. If you don't, [start a Fabric trial](../../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- Create or use an existing SQL database in Fabric.
    - If you don't have one already, [create a new SQL database in Fabric](create.md).
<!--    - During the current preview, we recommend using a copy of one of your existing databases or any existing test or development database that you can recover quickly from a backup. If you want to use a database from an existing backup, see [Restore a database from a backup in Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/recovery-using-backups). -->
- Currently, the only supported connection policy for SQL database in Microsoft Fabric is **Redirect**. For more information, see [Connection policy](limitations.md#connection-policy).

## Query editor in the Fabric portal

You can connect to the SQL database using the [web-based editor in the Fabric portal](query-editor.md).

The web-based editor for SQL database in Fabric provides a foundational object explorer and query execution interface. The integrated **Explorer** menu lists all database objects.

A new SQL database in Fabric automatically opens into the web editor and an existing database can be opened in the web editor by selecting it in Fabric.

## Find SQL connection string

In [!INCLUDE [product-name](../../includes/product-name.md)], the SQL analytics endpoint and SQL database are accessible through a Tabular Data Stream, or TDS endpoint, familiar to all modern web applications that interact with [a SQL Server TDS endpoint](/sql/relational-databases/security/networking/tds-8). This is referred to as the SQL connection string within the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../../includes/product-name.md)] user interface.

The connection string of the SQL database is similar to the connection string of Azure SQL Database, `<server-unique-identifer>.database.windows.net`. The SQL analytics endpoint connection string looks like `<server-unique-identifier>.<tenant>.fabric.microsoft.com`.

To find the SQL connection string for your **Fabric SQL database**:

- Go to the settings of your SQL database item.
- Or, in the item list, select the `...` menu. Select **Settings** then **Connection strings**. Fabric provides complete connection strings for providers including ADO.NET, JDBC, ODBC, PHP, and Go.
- Or, select the **Open in** button and **SQL Server Management Studio**. The server connection information is displayed.

To find the SQL connection string for the **SQL analytics endpoint** of your Fabric SQL database:

- Go to the settings of your SQL database item, then select **Connection strings**.
- Or, select the `...` menu, then select **SQL endpoint**, then copy the **SQL connection string**.

## Open in button to connect

You can easy connect to your SQL database with the **Open in** button in the Fabric portal [query editor](query-editor.md). Choose [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) or [the mssql extension with Visual Studio Code](/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/mssql-extensions?view=fabric&preserve-view=true).

## Connect with SQL Server Management Studio manually

:::image type="content" source="media/connect/sql-server-management-studio-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of SSMS settings." lightbox="media/connect/sql-server-management-studio-settings.png":::

In [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://aka.ms/ssms):

1. From your workspace area in the **Database** workload of Fabric, select the `...` next to your SQL database.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Connection strings**. Look for [the connection string to your SQL database](#find-sql-connection-string), including the `Data Source=`. For example, `tcp:<servername>.database.fabric.microsoft.com,1433`. The `Initial Catalog=` is the database name.
1. In SSMS, open a **New connection**.
1. From the Fabric dialog box, copy and paste the value from `Server Name` into the **Server name**.
1. Choose **Authentication** type: **Microsoft Entra ID - Universal with MFA support**.
1. Select **Options<<**.
1. Copy and paste the value from `Database Name` into the **Connect to database** text box.
1. Select **Connect**.
1. Sign in using **Microsoft Entra ID - Universal with MFA support**.

## Connect with sqlcmd

You can connect to your SQL database in Fabric with [sqlcmd](/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility?view=fabric&preserve-view=true), just like any other SQL Database Engine product. [Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication](/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-authentication?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) with the `G` option. The Microsoft Entra authentication (`-G`) requires at least version 13.1.

In the following example, replace `<server name>` with the long string of unique text that represents your SQL database in Fabric.

```cmd
sqlcmd -S <your_server>.database.fabric.microsoft.com;1433 -G -d <your_database> -i ./script.sql
```

## Connect with bcp utility

You can connect to your SQL database in Fabric with the [bcp utility](/sql/tools/bcp-utility?view=fabric&preserve-view=true), just like any other SQL Database Engine product. Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication with the `-G` option.

In the following example, replace `<server name>` with the long string of unique text that represents your SQL database in Fabric.

```cmd
bcp bcptest in "c:\temp\sample.dat" -S <your_server>.database.fabric.microsoft.com;1433 -d testdb -G -c
```

## Connect with Python Notebook

[Fabric Python Notebooks](../../data-engineering/using-python-experience-on-notebook.md) (preview) offer the [ability to run T-SQL code with the T-SQL magic command](../../data-engineering/tsql-magic-command-notebook.md). In the following steps, connect to a SQL database in Fabric using the `%%tsql` magic command:

1. Create a notebook in your workspace with the language set to Python.
1. In a cell, use the `%%tsql` magic command. The cell type automatically changes to `T-SQL`. 

   In the following sample, replace `<databasename>` with the name of your SQL database in Fabric. The `-type` parameter should be `SQLDatabase`.
   
   ```python
   %%tsql -artifact <databasename> -type SQLDatabase
   ```

   Then include your T-SQL command. For example, to run a query from a database named `Contoso`:

   ```python
   %%tsql -artifact Contoso -type SQLDatabase
   SELECT * FROM SalesLT.Customer;
   ```

For more possibilities to query your data with T-SQL inside Python Notebooks, see [Run T-SQL code in Fabric Python notebooks](../../data-engineering/tsql-magic-command-notebook.md). To see the full syntax, use the `%tsql?` command. This command displays the help information for the T-SQL magic command, including the available parameters and their descriptions.
