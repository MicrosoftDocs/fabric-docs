# Open mirroring (preview) partner ecosystem

[Open mirroring in Microsoft Fabric (Preview)](open-mirroring.md) is designed to be extensible, customizable, and open. It's a powerful feature that extends Mirroring in Fabric based on open Delta Lake table format. This capability enables any data providers to write change data directly into a mirrored database item in Microsoft Fabric.

The following are the open mirroring partners who have already built solutions to integrate with Microsoft Fabric.
