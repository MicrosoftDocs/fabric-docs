# Explore data in your mirrored database with notebooks

You can explore the data replicated from your mirrored database with Spark queries in notebooks.

Notebooks are a powerful code item for you to develop Apache Spark jobs and machine learning experiments on your data. You can use notebooks in the Fabric Lakehouse to explore your mirrored tables.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the tutorial to create a mirrored database from your source database.
    - [Tutorial: Create a mirrored database from Azure Cosmos DB](azure-cosmos-db-tutorial.md)
    - [Tutorial: Create a mirrored database from Azure SQL Database](azure-sql-database-tutorial.md)
    - [Tutorial: Create a mirrored database from Snowflake](snowflake-tutorial.md)

## Create a shortcut

You first need to create a shortcut from your mirrored tables into the Lakehouse, and then build notebooks with Spark queries in your Lakehouse.

1. In the Fabric portal, open **Data Engineering**.
1. If you don't have a Lakehouse created already, select **Lakehouse** and create a new Lakehouse by giving it a name.
1. Select **Get Data** -> **New shortcut**.
1. Select **Microsoft OneLake**.
1. You can see all your mirrored databases in the Fabric workspace.
1. Select the mirrored database you want to add to your Lakehouse, as a shortcut.
1. Select desired tables from the mirrored database.
1. Select **Next**, then **Create**.
1. In the **Explorer**, you can now see selected table data in your Lakehouse.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can add other data in Lakehouse directly or bring shortcuts like S3, ADLS Gen2. You can navigate to the **SQL analytics endpoint** of the Lakehouse and join the data across all these sources with mirrored data seamlessly. 

1. To explore this data in Spark, select the `...` dots next to any table. Select **New notebook** or **Existing notebook** to begin analysis.

1. The notebook will automatically open and the load the dataframe with a `SELECT ... LIMIT 1000` Spark SQL query.
    - New notebooks can take up to two minutes to load completely. You can avoid this delay by using an existing notebook with an active session.
