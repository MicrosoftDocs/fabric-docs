title: "Frequently asked questions for Mirroring SQL Server in Microsoft Fabric"
summary: |
  This article answers frequently asked questions about Mirroring SQL Server in Microsoft Fabric.

sections:
  - name: Features and capabilities
    questions:
      - question: |
          What authentication to the SQL Server is allowed? 
        answer: 
          Currently, for authentication to the source SQL Server, we support SQL authentication with user name and password and Microsoft Entra ID. 

      - question: |
           Is there a staging or landing zone for SQL Server? If so, is it outside of OneLake? 
        answer: 
          A landing zone in OneLake stores both the snapshot and change data, to improve performance when converting files into delta verti-parquet.

      - question: |
          How long does the initial replication take? 
        answer: 
          It depends on the size of the data that is being brought in. 

      - question: |
          How long does it take to replicate inserts/updates/deletes? 
        answer: 
          Near real-time latency.

      - question: |
          Do you support replicating of views, transient or external tables? 
        answer: 
          No. Currently, only replicating regular tables are supported.

      - question: |
          How do I manage connections? 
        answer: 
          In the mirroring page of the Fabric portal, select the settings button, then select **Manage connection and gateways**. You can also delete existing connections from this page.

      - question: |
          Can Power BI reports on mirrored data use direct lake mode?
        answer: 
          Yes, since tables are all v-ordered delta tables.

    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I know Fabric is replicating data on my SQL Server? 
        answer: |
           If you're experiencing mirroring problems, perform the following database level checks using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and stored procedures to validate configuration. See [Troubleshoot](sql-server-troubleshoot.md). [Contact support](/power-bi/support/service-support-options) if troubleshooting is required. 

      - question: |
          What are the replication statuses? 
        answer: 
          See [Monitor Fabric mirrored database replication](monitor.md).

      - question: |
          What steps does restarting the Mirroring include? 
        answer: 
           The data from source tables will be reinitialized. Each time you stop and start, the entire table is fetched again.

      - question: |
           What happens if I remove a table from Mirroring?
        answer: 
           The table is no longer replicated and its data is deleted from OneLake.

      - question: |
          If I delete the Mirror, does it affect the source SQL Server database? 
        answer: 
          No, we just remove the streaming tables.

      - question: |
          Can I mirror the same source database multiple times? 
        answer: 
          No, each SQL Server database can only be mirrored once. You just need a single copy of the data in Fabric OneLake, which you can share with others.

      - question: |
          Can I mirror only specific tables from my SQL Server database? 
        answer: 
          Yes, specific tables can be selected during Mirroring configuration.

    questions:
      - question: |
          Is data ever leaving the customers Fabric tenant? 
        answer: 
          No. 
      - question: |
          Is data staged outside of a customer environment? 
        answer: 
          No. Data isn't staged outside of customer environment, it's staged in the customer's OneLake.

  - name: Cost Management 
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the costs associated with Mirroring?
        answer: 
          Fabric compute used to replicate your data into Fabric OneLake is free. The Mirroring storage cost is free up to a limit based on capacity. For more information, see [Cost of mirroring](overview.md#cost-of-mirroring) and [Microsoft Fabric Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/). The compute for querying data using SQL, Power BI, or Spark is charged at regular rates.  
      - question: |
          How are ingress fees handled? 
        answer: 
          Fabric doesn't charge for Ingress fees into OneLake for Mirroring.

  - name: Licensing
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are licensing options for Fabric Mirroring? 
        answer:
          A Power BI Premium, Fabric Capacity, or Trial Capacity is required. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Fabric concepts and licenses](../../enterprise/licenses.md).

  - name: Stop or pause Fabric Mirroring
    questions:

      - question: |
          What are the results of stopping Mirroring?
        answer: 
          Replication stops in the source database, but a copy of the tables is kept in OneLake. Restarting the mirroring results in all data being replicated from the start.

      - question: |
          How to stop/disable Mirroring from your SQL Server?  
        answer: |
          If you're unable to Stop mirroring your SQL Server from the Fabric portal, or unable to delete your mirrored SQL Server item from Fabric, use the following steps.

          - In SQL Server 2025, execute the following stored procedure on your SQL Server database: `EXEC sp_change_feed_disable_db;`
          - In SQL Server 2016-2022, disable change data capture (CDC) using the following command: `EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_db;`

      - question: | 
          What if I stop or pause my Fabric capacity?
        answer: |
          The Fabric capacity needs to be active and running. A paused or deleted capacity will affect Mirroring and no data will be replicated.
