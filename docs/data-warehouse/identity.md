# IDENTITY columns

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

Surrogate keys are identifiers used in data warehousing to uniquely distinguish rows, independent of their natural keys. In Fabric Data Warehouse, `IDENTITY` columns enable automatic generation of these surrogate keys when inserting new rows into a table. This article explains how to use `IDENTITY` columns in Fabric Data Warehouse to create and manage surrogate keys efficiently.

## Why use an IDENTITY column?

`IDENTITY` columns eliminate the need for manual key assignment, reducing risk of errors and simplifying data ingestion. System-managed unique values are ideal as surrogate keys and primary keys. When compared to manual approaches to produce surrogate keys, `IDENTITY` columns offer superior performance as unique keys are generated automatically without extra logic on queries. 

The **bigint** data type, required for `IDENTITY` columns, can store up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 positive integer values, ensuring that throughout a table's lifetime, each row receives a unique value in its `IDENTITY` column.

For a plan to migrate data with surrogate keys from other database platforms, see [Migrate IDENTITY columns to Fabric Data Warehouse](migrate-identity-columns.md).

## Syntax

To define an `IDENTITY` column in Fabric Data Warehouse, the `IDENTITY` property is used with the desired column. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE { warehouse_name.schema_name.table_name | schema_name.table_name | table_name } (
    [column_name] BIGINT IDENTITY,
    [ ,... n ] 
    -- Other columns here    
);
```

## How IDENTITY columns work

Within Fabric Data Warehouse, you can't specify a custom starting value or increment; the system manages the values internally to ensure uniqueness. `IDENTITY` columns always produce positive integer values. Each new row receives a new value, and uniqueness is guaranteed for as long as the table exists. Once a value is used, `IDENTITY` doesn't use that same value again, preserving both key integrity and uniqueness. Gaps can appear on values that the `IDENTITY` column produces.

### Allocation of values

Due to the distributed architecture of the warehouse engine, the `IDENTITY` property doesn't guarantee the order in which the surrogate values are allocated. The `IDENTITY` property is designed to scale out across compute nodes to maximize parallelism, without affecting load performance. As a result, value ranges on different ingestion tasks might have different sequence ranges.

To illustrate this behavior, consider the following example:

```sql
-- Create a table with an IDENTITY column
CREATE TABLE dbo.T1(
    C1 BIGINT IDENTITY,
    C2 VARCHAR(30) NULL
)

-- Ingestion task A
INSERT INTO dbo.T1
VALUES (NULL), (NULL), (NULL), (NULL);

-- Ingestion task B
INSERT INTO dbo.T1
VALUES (NULL), (NULL), (NULL), (NULL);

-- Reviewing the data
SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;
```

Sample result:

:::image type="content" source="media/identity-overview/allocation-of-values.png" alt-text="A table with two columns labeled C1 and C2, showing eight rows of data. Column C1 contains large numeric values. Column C2 contains the text.":::

In this example, `Ingestion task A` and `Ingestion task B` are executed sequentially, as independent tasks. Although the tasks ran consecutively, the first and last four rows have different identity key ranges in `dbo.T1.C1`. In addition to that, as observed in this example, gaps in between the ranges assigned for task A and task B can occur.

`IDENTITY` in Fabric Data Warehouse guarantees that all values on an `IDENTITY` column are unique, but there can be gaps on the ranges produced for a given ingestion task.

#### System views

The [sys.identity_columns](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-identity-columns-transact-sql) catalog view can be used to list all identity columns on a warehouse. The following example lists all tables that contain an `IDENTITY` column on their definition, with their respective schema name, and the name of the `IDENTITY` column on that table:

```sql
SELECT
    s.name AS SchemaName,
    t.name AS TableName,
    c.name AS IdentityColumnName
FROM
    sys.identity_columns AS ic
INNER JOIN
    sys.columns AS c ON ic.[object_id] = c.[object_id]
    AND ic.column_id = c.column_id
INNER JOIN
    sys.tables AS t ON ic.[object_id] = t.[object_id]
INNER JOIN
    sys.schemas AS s ON t.[schema_id] = s.[schema_id]
ORDER BY
    s.name, t.name;
```

## Limitations

- Only the **bigint** data type is supported for `IDENTITY` columns in Fabric Data Warehouse. Attempting to use other data types result in an error.
- `IDENTITY_INSERT` isn't supported in Fabric Data Warehouse. Users can't update or manually insert column values on identity columns in Fabric Data Warehouse.
- Defining a `seed` and `increment` isn't supported. As a result, reseeding the `IDENTITY` column isn't supported.
- Adding a new `IDENTITY` column to an existing table with `ALTER TABLE` isn't supported. Consider using [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-as-select-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) or [SELECT... INTO](/sql/t-sql/queries/select-into-clause-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) as alternatives to create a copy of an existing table that adds an `IDENTITY` column to its definition.
- Some limitations apply to how `IDENTITY` columns are preserved when creating a new table as a result of a select from a different table with `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)` or `SELECT... INTO`. For more information, see the [Data Types section of SELECT - INTO Clause (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/queries/select-into-clause-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true#data-types).

## Examples

### A. Create a table with an IDENTITY column

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID BIGINT IDENTITY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

This statement creates an Employees table where every new row automatically receives a unique `EmployeeID` as a **bigint** value.

### B. INSERT on a table with an identity column

When the first column is an `IDENTITY` column, you don't need to specify it in the column list.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('Ensi','Vasala')
```

It's also possible to emit the column names, if values are provided for all columns of the destination table (except for the identity column):

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES ('Quarantino', 'Esposito')
```

### C. Create a new table with an IDENTITY column using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)

Considering a simple table as an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID BIGINT IDENTITY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

We can use `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) to create a copy of this table, persisting the `IDENTITY` property in the target table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE RetiredEmployees
AS SELECT * FROM Employees
```

The column on the target table inherits the `IDENTITY` property from the source table. For a list of limitations that apply to this scenario, refer to the [Data Types section of SELECT - INTO Clause](/sql/t-sql/queries/select-into-clause-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true#data-types).

### D. Create a new table with an IDENTITY column using SELECT... INTO

Considering a simple table as an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Employees (
    EmployeeID BIGINT IDENTITY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Retired BIT
);
```

We can use `SELECT... INTO` to create a copy of this table, persisting the `IDENTITY` property in the target table:

```sql
SELECT *
INTO dbo.RetiredEmployees
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE Retired = 1;
```

The column on the target table inherits the `IDENTITY` property from the source table. For a list of limitations that apply to this scenario, refer to the [Data Types section of SELECT - INTO Clause](/sql/t-sql/queries/select-into-clause-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true#data-types).
