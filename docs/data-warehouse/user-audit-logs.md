# User audit logs for Microsoft Fabric Data [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)]

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

To track user activity for meeting regulatory compliance and records managements requirements, a set of audit activities are accessible via Microsoft Purview and PowerShell. You can use user audit logs to identify who is taking what action on your Fabric items.

For more information on how to access user audit logs, visit [Track user activities in Microsoft Fabric](../admin/track-user-activities.md).

## Permissions

You must be a tenant/global admin or auditor to have access to user audit logs.
