# Query using the SQL query editor

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw-and-mirrored-db](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw-and-mirrored-db.md)]

This article describes how to use the SQL query editor in the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal to quickly and efficiently write queries, and suggestions on how best to see the information you need.

- You can also [query the data](query-warehouse.md) in your warehouse with multiple tools with a [SQL connection string](connectivity.md).
- You can build queries graphically with the [Visual query editor](visual-query-editor.md).
- You can quickly [view data in the Data preview](data-preview.md).

The SQL query editor provides support for IntelliSense, code completion, syntax highlighting, client-side parsing, and validation. You can run Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL) statements.

## SQL query editor in the Fabric portal

The SQL query editor provides a text editor to write queries using T-SQL. To access the built-in SQL query editor:

- Select the **Query** icon located at the bottom of the warehouse editor window.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/query-button-ribbon.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the SQL query editor query icon.":::

- Create a new query using the **New SQL query** button. If you select the dropdown, you can easily create T-SQL objects with code templates that populate in your SQL query window, as shown in the following image.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/new-sql-query-dropdown-templates.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to find the New query menu on the Data preview view ribbon.":::

### View query results

Once you've written the T-SQL query, select **Run** to execute the query.

The **Results** preview is displayed in the **Results** section. If number of rows returned is more than 10,000 rows, the preview is limited to 10,000 rows. You can search string within results grid to get filtered rows matching search criteria. The **Messages** tab shows SQL messages returned when SQL query is run.

The status bar indicates the query status, duration of the run and number of rows and columns returned in results.

To enable **Save as view**, **Save as table**, **Download Excel file**, and **Visualize results** menus, highlight the SQL statement containing `SELECT` statement in the SQL query editor.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/editor-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the query editor window. Command buttons are boxed in red." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/editor-commands.png":::

#### Save as view

You can select the query and save your query as a view using the **Save as view** button. Select the schema name that you have access to create views, provide name of view and verify the SQL statement before confirming creating view. When view is successfully created, it appears in the **Explorer**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/save-as-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to use Save as view menu.":::

#### Save as table

You can use **Save as table** to save your query results into a table. Select the warehouse in which you would like to save results, select schema that you have access to create tables and provide table name to load results into the table using [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-as-select-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) statement. When table is successfully created, it appears in the **Explorer**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/save-as-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to use Save as table menu.":::

#### Download Excel file

The **Download Excel file** button opens the corresponding T-SQL Query to Excel and executes the query, enabling you to work with the results in Microsoft Excel on your local computer.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/download-excel-file-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to use Download Excel file menu." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/download-excel-file-query.png":::

Follow these steps to work with the Excel file locally:

1. After you select the **Continue** button, locate the downloaded Excel file in your Windows File Explorer, for example, in the **Downloads** folder of your browser.
1. To see the data, select the **Enable Editing** button in the **Protected View** ribbon followed by the **Enable Content** button in the **Security Warning** ribbon. Once both are enabled, you are presented with the following dialog to approve running the query listed.
   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/native-database-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot from Microsoft Excel showing the Native Database Query dialog." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/native-database-query.png":::

1. Select **Run**.
1. Select one of the following methods (Windows, Database, or Microsoft account) to authenticate your account. Select **Connect**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/sql-server-database-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot from Microsoft Excel showing the SQL Server database dialog." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/sql-server-database-authentication.png":::

Once you have successfully signed in, you'll see the data presented in the spreadsheet.

#### Visualize results

**Visualize results** allows you to create reports from your query results within the SQL query editor.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/visualize-results-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to use Visualize results menu." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/visualize-results-query.png":::

As you work on your SQL query, the queries are automatically saved every few seconds. A "saving" indicator appears in your query tab at the bottom to indicate that your query is being saved.

#### Multiple result sets

When you run multiple queries and those return multiple results, you can select results dropdown list to see individual results.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/sql-query-editor-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the query editor window with results." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/sql-query-editor-overview.png":::

## Cross-warehouse querying

For more information on cross-warehouse querying, see [Cross-warehouse querying](query-warehouse.md#write-a-cross-database-query).

You can write a T-SQL query with three-part naming convention to refer to objects and join them across warehouses, for example:

```sql
SELECT 
   emp.Employee
   ,SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit
   ,SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold
FROM
   [SampleWarehouse].[dbo].[DimEmployee] as emp
JOIN
   [WWI_Sample].[dbo].[FactSale] as sale
ON
   emp.EmployeeKey = sale.SalespersonKey
WHERE  
   emp.IsSalesperson = 'TRUE'
GROUP BY
   emp.Employee
ORDER BY
   TotalProfit DESC;
```

## Limitations

- In SQL query editor, every time you run the query, it opens a separate session and closes it at the end of the execution. This means if you set up session context for multiple query runs, the context is not maintained for independent execution of queries.

- You can run Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL) statements, but there are limitations for Transaction Control Language (TCL) statements. In the SQL query editor, when you select the **Run** button, you're submitting an independent batch request to execute. Each **Run** action in the SQL query editor is a batch request, and a session only exists per batch. Each execution of code in the same query window runs in a different batch and session.

   - For example, when independently executing transaction statements, session context is not retained. In the following screenshot, `BEGIN TRAN` was executed in the first request, but since the second request was executed in a different session, there is no transaction to commit, resulting into the failure of commit/rollback operation. If the SQL batch submitted does not include a COMMIT TRAN, the changes applied after `BEGIN TRAN` will not commit.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-query-editor/transaction-run-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing independent run of transactions failed in SQL query editor." lightbox="media/sql-query-editor/transaction-run-error.png":::

   - The SQL query editor does not support `sp_set_session_context`.

   - In the SQL query editor, the `GO` SQL command creates a new independent batch in a new session.

- When you are running a SQL query with [USE](/sql/t-sql/language-elements/use-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true), you need to submit the SQL query with `USE` as one single request.

- Visualize Results currently does not support SQL queries with an ORDER BY clause. 

- The following table summarizes the expected behavior will not match with [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)/[Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio):

   | **Scenario** | **Supported in SSMS/ADS** | **Supported in SQL query editor in Fabric portal** |
   |---|---|---|
   |Using [SET Statements (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/statements/set-statements-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) to set properties for session |Yes|No|
   |Using [sp_set_session_context (Transact-SQL)](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-set-session-context-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) for multiple batch statements runs |Yes|No|
   |[Transactions (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transactions-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) (unless executed as a single batch request) |Yes|No|
