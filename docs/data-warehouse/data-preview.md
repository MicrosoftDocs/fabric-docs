# View data in the Data preview in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw-and-mirrored-db](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw-and-mirrored-db.md)]

The **Data preview** is one of the three switcher modes along with the Query editor and Model view within Synapse Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric that provides an easy interface to view the data within your tables or views to preview sample data (top 1000 rows).

- You can also [query the data](query-warehouse.md) in your warehouse with multiple tools with a [SQL connection string](connectivity.md).
- You can use the [SQL query editor](sql-query-editor.md) to write T-SQL queries from the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal.
- You can build queries graphically with the [Visual query editor](visual-query-editor.md).

## Get started

After creating a warehouse and ingesting data, select the **Data** tab. Choose a specific table or view you would like to display in the data grid of the Data preview page.

 - **Search value** – Type in a specific keyword in the search bar and rows with that specific keyword will be filtered. In this example, "New York" is the keyword and only rows containing this keyword are shown. To clear the search, select on the `X` inside the search bar.

 - **Sort columns (alphabetically or numerically)** – Hover over the column title and select on the up/down arrow that appears next to the title.

 - **Copy value** – Right-click a cell within the table and a **Copy** option will appear to copy the specific selection.

## Considerations and limitations

 - Only the top 1000 rows can be shown in the data grid of the Data preview. 
 - The Data preview view changes depending on how the columns are sorted or if there's a keyword that is searched.
