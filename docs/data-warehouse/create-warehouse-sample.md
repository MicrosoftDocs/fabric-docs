# Create a sample Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

This article describes how to get started with sample [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] using the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal, including creation and consumption of the warehouse.

## How to create a new warehouse with sample data

In this section, we walk you through creating a new [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] with sample data.

### Create a warehouse sample using the Home hub

1. The first hub in the navigation pane is the **Home** hub. You can start creating your warehouse sample from the **Home** hub by selecting the **Warehouse sample** card under the **New** section.

1. Provide the name for your sample warehouse and select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-warehouse-sample/home-hub-provide-sample-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Warehouse creation experience in the Home hub.":::

1. The create action creates a new [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] and start loading sample data into it. The data loading takes few seconds to complete.

1. On completion of loading sample data, the warehouse opens with data loaded into tables and views to query.

### Load sample data into existing warehouse

1. Once you have created your warehouse, you can load sample data into warehouse from **Use sample database** card.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-warehouse-sample/use-sample-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the Warehouse card in the Create hub." lightbox="media/create-warehouse-sample/use-sample-database.png":::

1. The data loading takes few seconds to complete.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-warehouse-sample/loading-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the loading sample data into warehouse." lightbox="media/create-warehouse-sample/loading-sample-data.png":::

1. On completion of loading sample data, the warehouse displays data loaded into tables and views to query.

### Sample scripts

Your new warehouse is ready to accept T-SQL queries. The following sample T-SQL scripts can be used on the sample data in your new warehouse.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that much of the functionality described in this section is also available to users via a TDS end-point connection and tools such as [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) or [Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) (for users who prefer to use T-SQL for the majority of their data processing needs). For more information, see [Connectivity](connectivity.md) or [Query a warehouse](query-warehouse.md).

```sql

/*************************************************
Get number of trips performed by each medallion
**************************************************/

SELECT 
    M.MedallionID
    ,M.MedallionCode
    ,COUNT(T.TripDistanceMiles) AS TotalTripCount
FROM   
    dbo.Trip AS T
JOIN   
    dbo.Medallion AS M
ON 
    T.MedallionID=M.MedallionID
GROUP BY 
    M.MedallionID
    ,M.MedallionCode

/****************************************************
How many passengers are being picked up on each trip?
*****************************************************/
SELECT
    PassengerCount,
    COUNT(*) AS CountOfTrips
FROM 
    dbo.Trip
WHERE 
    PassengerCount > 0
GROUP BY 
    PassengerCount
ORDER BY 
    PassengerCount

/*********************************************************************************
What is the distribution of trips by hour on working days (non-holiday weekdays)?
*********************************************************************************/
SELECT
    ti.HourlyBucket,
    COUNT(*) AS CountOfTrips
FROM dbo.Trip AS tr
INNER JOIN dbo.Date AS d
    ON tr.DateID = d.DateID
INNER JOIN dbo.Time AS ti
    ON tr.PickupTimeID = ti.TimeID
WHERE
    d.IsWeekday = 1
    AND d.IsHolidayUSA = 0
GROUP BY
    ti.HourlyBucket
ORDER BY
    ti.HourlyBucket
```
