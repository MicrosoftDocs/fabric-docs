# Create tables in the warehouse

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

This article provides two examples that show how to create a new table in Fabric Data Warehouse, from a parquet file or through the warehouse editor in the Fabric portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Have access to a [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] item within a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-what-is) workspace with contributor or higher permissions.
    - Be sure to connect to your warehouse item. You cannot create tables directly in the SQL analytics endpoint of a warehouse.
- Choose your query tool. This tutorial features the [SQL query editor](sql-query-editor.md) in the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal, but you can use any T-SQL querying tool.

For more information on connecting to your [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], see [Connectivity](connectivity.md). 

## Create a blank table in the SQL query editor with templates

1. In the warehouse editor ribbon, locate the **SQL templates** dropdown list. 
1. Select **New table**, and an autogenerated [CREATE TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) script template appears in your new SQL query window.
1. Update the table name and column definitions in the `CREATE TABLE` template to match the structure you need. Your T-SQL script should look similar to the following code:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[bing_covid]
    (
        id                int,
        updated           date,
        confirmed         int,
        confirmed_change  int,
        deaths            int,
        deaths_change     int,
        recovered         int,
        recovered_change  int,
        latitude          float,
        longitude         float,
        iso2              varchar(2),
        iso3              varchar(3),
        country_region    varchar(60),
        admin_region_1    varchar(60),
        iso_subdivision   varchar(30),
        admin_region_2    varchar(60),
        load_time         datetime2(6)
    );
    ```

1. Select **Run** to create the table.

To learn more about supported table creation in Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric, see [Tables in data warehousing in Microsoft Fabric](tables.md) and [Data types in Microsoft Fabric](data-types.md).

## Create a loaded table in the SQL query editor from an external file

You can also create a table directly from an external parquet file that you have access to. In this example, we'll create a new table based on a publicly available data file. In the query editor, paste and run the following T-SQL code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.bing_covid AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(BULK 'https://pandemicdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/public/curated/covid-19/bing_covid-19_data/latest/bing_covid-19_data.parquet');
```

The **CTAS** (Create Table As Select) statement creates a new table and populates it with data retrieved from the specified source file, streamlining the process of both defining and loading the table in a single step. You can find more ingestion options in [Ingest data with T-SQL](ingest-data-tsql.md) page.
