# Create tables in the Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Have access to a [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] item within a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-what-is) workspace with contributor or higher permissions.
- Choose your query tool. This tutorial features the SQL query editor in the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal, but you can use any T-SQL querying tool.
    - Use the [SQL query editor in the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal](sql-query-editor.md).

For more information on connecting to your [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], see [Connectivity](connectivity.md). 

### Create a new table in the SQL query editor with templates

1. In the warehouse editor ribbon, locate the **SQL templates** dropdown list. 
1. Select **New table**, and an autogenerated [CREATE TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) script template appears in your new SQL query window.
1. Modify the `CREATE TABLE` template to suit your new table.
1. Select **Run** to create the table.
