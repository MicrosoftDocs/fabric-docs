# Tutorial: Load data using T-SQL

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

Now that you know how to build a data warehouse, load a table, and generate a report, it's time to extend the solution by exploring other methods for loading data.

## Load data with COPY INTO

1. From the ribbon, select **New SQL query**.

1. In the query editor, paste the following code.

   ```sql
   --Copy data from the public Azure storage account to the dbo.dimension_city table.
   COPY INTO [dbo].[dimension_city]
   FROM 'https://azuresynapsestorage.blob.core.windows.net/sampledata/WideWorldImportersDW/tables/dimension_city.parquet'
   WITH (FILE_TYPE = 'PARQUET');
   
   --Copy data from the public Azure storage account to the dbo.fact_sale table.
   COPY INTO [dbo].[fact_sale]
   FROM 'https://azuresynapsestorage.blob.core.windows.net/sampledata/WideWorldImportersDW/tables/fact_sale.parquet'
   WITH (FILE_TYPE = 'PARQUET');
   ```

1. Select **Run** to execute the query. The query takes between one and four minutes to execute.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-data/select-run-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Run to execute your query.":::

1. After the query is completed, review the messages to see the rows affected which indicated the number of rows that were loaded into the `dimension_city` and `fact_sale` tables respectively.

1. Load the data preview to validate the data loaded successfully by selecting on the `fact_sale` table in the **Explorer**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-data/explorer-select-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Explorer, showing where to find and select the table.":::

1. Rename the query for reference later. Right-click on **SQL query 1** in the **Explorer** and select **Rename**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-data/right-click-rename.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Explorer pane, showing where to right-click on the table name and select Rename.":::

1. Type `Load Tables` to change the name of the query.

1. Press **Enter** on the keyboard or select anywhere outside the tab to save the change.
