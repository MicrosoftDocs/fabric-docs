# Data types in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Tables in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] support the most commonly used T-SQL data types.

- For more information on table creation, see [Tables](tables.md).

## Data types in Warehouse

[!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] supports a subset of T-SQL data types:

| **Category** | **Supported data types** |
|---|---|
| **Exact numerics** | <ul><li>**bit**</li><li>**bigint**</li><li>**int**</li><li>**smallint**</li><li>**decimal**</li><li>**numeric**</li></ul> |
| **Approximate numerics** | <ul><li>**float**</li><li>**real**</li></ul> |
| **Date and time** | <ul><li>**date**</li><li>**datetime2**</li><li>**time**</li></ul> |
| **Character strings** | <ul><li>**char**</li><li>**varchar**</li></ul> |
| **Binary strings** | <ul><li>**varbinary**</li><li>**uniqueidentifer**</li></ul> |

> [!NOTE]
> The precision for **datetime2** and **time** is limited to 6 digits of precision on fractions of seconds.

The **uniqueidentifier** data type is a T-SQL data type, without a matching data type in Delta Parquet. As a result, it's stored as a binary type. [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] supports storing and reading **uniqueidentifier** columns, but these values can't be read on the [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-se.md)]. Reading **uniqueidentifier** values in the lakehouse displays a binary representation of the original values. As a result, features such as cross-joins between [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] and [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-se.md)] using a **uniqueidentifier** column doesn't work as expected.

For more information about the supported data types including their precisions, see [data types in CREATE TABLE reference](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true#DataTypesFabric).

### Unsupported data types

For T-SQL data types that aren't currently supported, some alternatives are available. Make sure you evaluate the use of these types, as precision and query behavior vary:

| **Unsupported data type** | **Alternatives available** |
|---|---|
| **money** and **smallmoney** | Use **decimal**, however note that it can't store the monetary unit.  |
| **datetime** and **smalldatetime** | Use **datetime2**. |
| **nchar** and **nvarchar** | Use **char** and **varchar** respectively, as there's no similar **unicode** data type in Parquet. The **char** and **varchar** types in a UTF-8 collation might use more storage than **nchar** and **nvarchar** to store unicode data. To understand the impact on your environment, see [Storage differences between UTF-8 and UTF-16](/sql/relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support?view=fabric&preserve-view=true#storage_differences). |
| **text and ntext** | Use **varchar**. |
| **image** | Use **varbinary**. |

Unsupported data types can still be used in T-SQL code for variables, or any in-memory use in session. Creating tables or views that persist data on disk with any of these types isn't allowed.

For a guide to create a table in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)], see [Create tables](create-table.md).

## Autogenerated data types in the SQL analytics endpoint

The tables in [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] are automatically created whenever a table is created in the associated lakehouse. The column types in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] tables are derived from the source Delta types.

The rules for mapping original Delta types to the SQL types in [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] are shown in the following table:

| Delta data type | SQL data type (mapped) |
| :---| :---|
| **LONG**, **BIGINT** | **bigint** |
| **BOOLEAN**, **BOOL** | **bit** |
| **INT**, **INTEGER** | **int** |
| **TINYINT**, **BYTE**, **SMALLINT**, **SHORT** | **smallint** |
| **DOUBLE** | **float** |
| **FLOAT**, **REAL** | **real** |
| **DATE** | **date** |
| **TIMESTAMP** | **datetime2** |
| **CHAR**(n) | **varchar**(n) with `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` collation |
| **STRING**, **VARCHAR**(n) | **varchar**(n) with `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` collation |
| **STRING**, **VARCHAR**(MAX) | **varchar**(8000) with `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` collation |
| **BINARY** | **varbinary**(n) |
| **DECIMAL**, **DEC**, **NUMERIC** | **decimal**(p,s) |

The columns that have the types that aren't listed in the table aren't represented as the table columns in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)].
