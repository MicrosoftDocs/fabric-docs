# T-SQL surface area in Fabric Data Warehouse

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

This article covers the T-SQL language syntax capabilities of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], when querying the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] or [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)].

For SQL database in Fabric, see [Features comparison: Azure SQL Database and SQL database in Microsoft Fabric (preview)](../database/sql/feature-comparison-sql-database-fabric.md) and [Limitations in SQL database (preview)](../database/sql/limitations.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on upcoming feature development for Fabric Data Warehouse, see the [Fabric Data Warehouse release plan](/fabric/release-plan/data-warehouse).

## T-SQL surface area

- Creating, altering, and dropping tables, and insert, update, and delete are only supported in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], not in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] of the Lakehouse.
- You can create your own T-SQL views, functions, and procedures on top of the tables that reference your Delta Lake data in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] of the Lakehouse.
- For more about CREATE/DROP TABLE support, see [Tables](tables.md).
- Fabric Warehouse and SQL analytics endpoint both support *standard*, *sequential*, and *nested* CTEs. While CTEs are generally available in Microsoft Fabric, nested CTEs are currently a preview feature. For more information, see [Nested Common Table Expression (CTE) in Fabric data warehousing (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/queries/nested-common-table-expression?view=fabric&preserve-view=true).
- For more about data types, see [Data types](data-types.md).
- [TRUNCATE TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/truncate-table-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) is supported in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].
- To change the name of the column in a user table in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)], use the `sp_rename` stored procedure. 
- A subset of query and join hints are supported. For more information, see [Hints (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query?view=fabric&preserve-view=true).
- Session-scoped distributed #temp tables are supported in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

### Limitations

At this time, the following list of commands is NOT currently supported. Don't try to use these commands. Even though they might appear to succeed, they could cause issues to your warehouse.

- `ALTER TABLE ADD`/`ALTER`
    - Currently, only the following subset of `ALTER TABLE` operations in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] are supported:
      - ADD nullable columns of supported column data types.
      - `DROP COLUMN`
      - ADD or DROP PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and FOREIGN_KEY column constraints, but only if the NOT ENFORCED option has been specified. All other ALTER TABLE operations are blocked.
      - There are limitations with adding table constraints or columns when using [Source Control with Warehouse](source-control.md#limitations-in-source-control).
- `BULK LOAD`
- `CREATE USER`
- `FOR JSON` must be the last operator in the query, and so is not allowed inside subqueries
- IDENTITY Columns
- Manually created multi-column stats
- Materialized views
- `MERGE`
- `PREDICT`
- Queries targeting system and user tables
- Recursive queries
- Result Set Caching
- Schema and table names can't contain `/` or `\`
- `SELECT` - `FOR XML`
- `SET ROWCOUNT`
- `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`
- `sp_showspaceused`
- Triggers
