# T-SQL surface area in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

This article covers the T-SQL language syntax capabilities of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], when querying the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] or [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on upcoming feature development for Fabric Synapse Data Warehouse, see the [Synapse Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric release plan](/fabric/release-plan/data-warehouse).

## T-SQL surface area

- Creating, altering, and dropping tables, and insert, update, and delete are only supported in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], not in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] of the Lakehouse.
- You can create your own T-SQL views, functions, and procedures on top of the tables that reference your Delta Lake data in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] of the Lakehouse.
- For more about CREATE/DROP TABLE support, see [Tables](tables.md).
- For more about data types, see [Data types](data-types.md).

### Limitations

- `ALTER TABLE ADD`/`ALTER`/`DROP COLUMN`
    - Currently, `ALTER TABLE` in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] is only supported for constraints.
- `BULK LOAD`
- `CREATE ROLE`
- `CREATE USER`
- Hints
- IDENTITY Columns
- Manually created multi-column stats
- Materialized views
- `MERGE`
- `OPENROWSET`
- `PREDICT`
- Queries targeting system and user tables
- Recursive queries
- Result Set Caching
- Schema and table names can't contain `/` or `\`
