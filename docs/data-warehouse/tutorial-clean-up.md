# Tutorial: Clean up tutorial resources

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Now that you've completed all tutorials, we recommend that you clean up by removing the tutorial workspace. Removing the workspace will help conserve your capacity resources.
