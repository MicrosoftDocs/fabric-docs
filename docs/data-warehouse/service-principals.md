# Service principal in Fabric Data Warehouse

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

An Azure service principal (SPN) is a security identity used by applications or automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Unlike user identities, service principals are non-interactive, application-based identities that can be assigned precise permissions, making them perfect for automated processes or background services. By using service principals, you can connect to your data sources securely while minimizing the risks of human error and identity-based vulnerabilities. To learn more about service principals, see [Application and service principal objects in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals).

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a service principal, assign roles, and create secretÂ using Azure](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal).
1. Ensure the tenant admin can enable **Service principals can use Fabric APIs** in Fabric Admin portal.

1. Ensure a user with Administrator [workspace role](workspace-roles.md) can grant access for an SPN through **Manage access** in the Workspace.

## Create and access warehouses through REST APIs using SPN

Users with administrator, member, or contributor [workspace role](workspace-roles.md) can use service principals for authentication to create, update, read, and delete Warehouse items via Fabric [REST APIs](/rest/api/fabric/warehouse/items). This allows you to automate repetitive tasks such as provisioning or managing warehouses without relying on user credentials.

If you use a delegated account or fixed identity (owner's identity) to create the warehouse, the warehouse will use that credential while accessing OneLake. This creates a problem when the owner leaves the organization, because the warehouse will stop working. **To avoid this, create warehouses using an SPN.**

Fabric also requires the user to sign in every 30 days to ensure a valid token is provided for security reasons. For a data warehouse, the owner needs to sign in to Fabric every 30 days. This can be automated using an SPN with the [List](/rest/api/fabric/warehouse/items/list-warehouses?tabs=HTTP) API.

Warehouses created by an SPN using REST APIs will be displayed in the Workspace list view in the Fabric portal, with the **Owner** name as the SPN. In the following image, a screenshot from the workspace in the Fabric portal, "Fabric Public API test app" is the SPN that created the Contoso Marketing Warehouse.

### Connect to client applications using SPN

You can connect to Fabric warehouses by using service principals with tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 19 or higher versions.

- **Authentication**: **Microsoft Entra Service Principal**
- **User name**: Client ID of SPN (created through Azure in Prerequisite section)
- **Password**: Secret (created through Azure in Prerequisite section)

### Control plane permissions

SPNs can be granted access to warehouses using [workspace roles](workspace-roles.md) through **Manage access** in the workspace. In addition, warehouses can be shared with an SPN through the Fabric portal via [Item Permissions](share-warehouse-manage-permissions.md). 

### Data plane permissions

Once warehouses are provided control plane permissions to an SPN through workspace roles or Item permissions, administrators can use T-SQL commands like `GRANT` to assign specific [data plane permissions](../security/permission-model.md#compute-permissions) to service principals, to control precisely which metadata/data and operations an SPN has access to. This is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege.

For example:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON <table name> TO <service principal name>;
```

Once permissions are granted, SPNs can connect to client application tools like SSMS, thereby providing secure access for developers to run COPY INTO (with and without firewall enabled storage), and also to run any T-SQL query programmatically on a schedule with [Data Factory pipelines](../data-factory/pipeline-landing-page.md).

### Monitor

When an SPN runs queries in the warehouse, there are various monitoring tools that provide visibility into the user or SPN that ran the query. You can find the user for query activity the following ways:

- [Dynamic management views (DMVs)](monitor-using-dmv.md): `login_name` column in `sys.dm_exec_sessions`.
- [Query Insights](query-insights.md): `login_name` column in `queryinsights.exec_requests_history` view.
- [Query activity](query-activity.md): `submitter` column in Fabric query activity.
- [Capacity metrics app](../enterprise/metrics-app.md): Compute usage for warehouse operations performed by SPN appears as the Client ID under the **User** column in Background operations drill through table.

For more information, see [Monitor Fabric Data warehouse](monitoring-overview.md).
  
### Takeover API

Ownership of warehouses can be changed from an SPN to user, and from a user to an SPN.

- Takeover from SPN or user to user: See [Change ownership of Fabric Warehouse](change-ownership.md).
- Takeover from SPN or user to SPN: Use a POST call on REST API.

  ```HTTP
  POST <PowerBI Global Service FQDN>/v1.0/myorg/groups/{workspaceid}/datawarehouses/{warehouseid}/takeover
  ```
  
### Limitations

Limitations of service principals with Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse:

- Service principal or Entra ID credentials are currently not supported for COPY INTO error files.
- Service principals are not supported for [GIT APIs](/rest/api/fabric/core/git). SPN support exists only for [Deployment pipeline APIs](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines).
- Service principals are currently not allowed to perform DCL operations within the warehouse. This includes `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `DENY` commands, regardless of the target principal's existence.
- Service principals cannot trigger operations that result in the automatic creation of user identities within the data warehouse. This includes scenarios where the system would normally attempt to create a user as part of an operation. Examples of operations that may trigger implicit user creation include:
  - `ALTER USER ... WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA`
  - `ALTER ROLE ... ADD MEMBER`
