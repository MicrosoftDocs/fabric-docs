# Warehouse settings and context menus

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Settings are accessible from the context menu or from the Settings icon in the ribbon when you open the item. There are some key differences in the actions you can take in settings depending on if you're interacting with the SQL analytics endpoint or a data warehouse.

## Settings options

This section describes and explains the settings options available based on the item you're working with and its description.

The following image shows the warehouse settings menu.

The following table is a list of settings available for each warehouse.

| **Setting** | **Detail** | **Editable for** |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Lets user read/edit name of the warehouse. | Warehouse |
| **Warehouse description** | Lets users add metadata details to provide descriptive information about a warehouse. | Warehouse |
| **Owned by** | Name of the user who owns the warehouse. | |
| **Last modified by** | Name of the user who modified the warehouse recently. | |
| **SQL connection string** | The SQL connection string for the workspace. You can use the SQL connection string to create a connection to the warehouse using various tools, such as SSMS/Azure Data Studio. | |
| **Sensitivity label** | Classify your warehouse to protect it from unauthorized access. | |
| **Endorsement and discovery** | Endorse the warehouse and make it discoverable in your org. |


The following table shows settings for the default Power BI semantic model.

| **Setting** | **Details** |
|---|---|
| **Request access** | Request access to the default Power BI semantic model. |
| **Q&A** | Use natural language to ask question on your data. |
| **Query caching** | Turn on or off caching query results for speeding up reports by using previously saved query results. |
| **Server settings** | The XMLA connection string of the default semantic model. |
| **Endorsement and discovery** | Endorse the default semantic model independently from warehouse and make it discoverable in your org. |

## Context menus

*Applies to:* [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

Warehouse offers an easy experience to create reports and access supported actions using its context menus.

:::image type="content" source="media/settings-context-menus/warehouse-context-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the warehouse context menu.":::

The following table describes the warehouse context menu options:

| **Menu option** | **Option description** |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Opens warehouse to explore and analyze data. |
| **Open with** | Opens warehouse in Azure Data Studio. |
| **Share** | Lets users share the warehouse to build content based on the underlying default Power BI semantic model, query data using SQL or get access to underlying data files. Shares the warehouse access (SQL connections only, and autogenerated semantic model) with other users in your organization. Users receive an email with links to access the detail page where they can find the SQL connection string and can access the default semantic model to create reports based on it. |
| **Analyze in Excel** | Uses the existing Analyze in Excel capability on default Power BI semantic model. Learn more: [Analyze in Excel](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-analyze-in-excel). |
| **Create report** | Build a report in DirectQuery mode. Learn more: [Get started creating in the Power BI service](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-get-started) |
| **Rename** | Updates the warehouse with the new name. Does not apply to the SQL analytics endpoint of the Lakehouse. |
| **Delete** | Delete warehouse from workspace. A confirmation dialog notifies you of the impact of the delete action. If the Delete action is confirmed, then the warehouse and related downstream items are deleted. Does not apply to the SQL analytics endpoint of the Lakehouse.|
| **Manage permissions** | Enables users to add other recipients with specified permissions, similar to allowing the sharing of an underlying semantic model or allowing to build content with the data associated with the underlying semantic model. |
| **Settings** | Learn more about warehouse settings in the previous section. |
| **View lineage** | This option shows the end-to-end lineage of warehouse from the data sources to the warehouse, the default Power BI semantic model, and other semantic models (if any) that were built on top of the warehouse, all the way to deports, dashboards and apps. |
| **View details** | Opens up warehouse details in Data hub. |
