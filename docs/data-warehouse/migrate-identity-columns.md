# Migrate to IDENTITY columns in Fabric Data Warehouse

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

You can migrate tables to Fabric Data Warehouse with surrogate key columns after adapting to the differences in the `IDENTITY` implementation in Fabric Data Warehouse. This article outlines a robust migration strategy to help you bridge this gap and successfully move your schema and data into Fabric Data Warehouse.

Migrating databases to Fabric Data Warehouse presents unique challenges for organizations that rely on existing surrogate columns, such as `IDENTITY` or `SEQUENCE` functions in the SQL Database Engine:

- Unlike traditional SQL Server environments, Fabric Data Warehouse uses a distributed model for generating identity values, which ensures uniqueness but doesn't guarantee sequential order.
    - `IDENTITY` in Fabric Data Warehouse does not support `IDENTITY_INSERT`. You cannot directly insert existing values. 
    - `IDENTITY` in Fabric Data Warehouse does not support configuring the `SEED` or `INCREMENT`. `IDENTITY` values are unique and automatically managed.
- Only the **bigint** data type is supported for `IDENTITY` columns in Fabric Data Warehouse. 
- Fabric Data Warehouse doesn't enforce key constraints.

## Step-by-step migration process

To illustrate the approach described in this article, consider two tables: a `Customers` table, and an `Orders` table. The `Orders` table references the `Customers` table using the `CustomerID` column.

To migrate these tables from the source into Fabric Data Warehouse tables that use `IDENTITY` columns, we need to rehydrate the destination table with new IDs and update the referenced table. We can achieve that by using the following strategy: 

1. Load data from source tables into staging tables in Fabric Data Warehouse that don't use `IDENTITY` columns.
1. Load data from staging tables into final tables that use an `IDENTITY` column, but copy the original data of the ID column from the staging table into a new, temporary column in the final tables.
1. `UPDATE` references in related tables.

## Example: migrate data from tables that use IDENTITY columns to Fabric Data Warehouse

The next steps describe how this strategy can be accomplished using `IDENTITY` columns in Fabric Data Warehouse. 

### Step 1: Load source data into staging tables

Begin by creating staging tables in Fabric Data Warehouse that mirror the schema of your source tables, but create the staging tables with `IDENTITY` columns. 

Load your source data into these staging tables, including the original identity values.

### Step 2: Insert data into destination tables and map legacy IDENTITY values

Next, insert data from the staging tables into the destination tables in your warehouse. 

The destination table should use `IDENTITY` on the key column. 

During this step, map the original identity values from the staging table to a new column in the destination table.

For example, when migrating a `Customers` table, you could use a statement like:

```sql
-- Pseudo code: replace ... with your own column list
INSERT INTO dbo.Customers (Name, Email, ... , LegacyCustomerID)
SELECT s.Name, s.Email, ..., s.CustomerID
FROM dbo.Staging_Customers AS s;
```

This approach preserves the original identity value in the `LegacyCustomerID` column for use in subsequent steps. 

Repeat this step for all tables in your warehouse that use `IDENTITY` columns.

### Step 3: Update foreign key relationships using legacy identity values

For tables with foreign keys referencing an `IDENTITY` column, join the staging version of the referenced table using the temporary legacy ID column to obtain the new Fabric Data Warehouse-generated IDs.

For example, when migrating an `Orders` table that references Customers:

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.Orders (OrderDate, ... , CustomerID)
SELECT o.OrderDate, ..., c.CustomerID
FROM dbo.Staging_Orders AS o
INNER JOIN dbo.Customers AS c
ON o.CustomerID = c.LegacyCustomerID; 
```

This approach ensures that relationships between tables are preserved even as new `IDENTITY` produces new IDs moving forward. 

### Step 4 (Optional): Clean up temporary columns

After confirming that all relationships are correctly mapped and data integrity is maintained, if desired, you can drop the legacy ID columns from your destination tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Orders 
DROP COLUMN LegacyCustomerID;
```

Optionally, keep the columns like `LegacyCustomerID` in the final table for future audits, lineage, or troubleshooting reasons.
