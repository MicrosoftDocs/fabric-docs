# Overview of OneLake table APIs

OneLake offers a REST API endpoint for interacting with tables in Microsoft Fabric. This endpoint can be used with clients and libraries that are compatible with [the Iceberg REST Catalog (IRC) API open standard](https://iceberg.apache.org/rest-catalog-spec/) or the [Unity Catalog API open standard.](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/tree/main/api). 

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)] 

## Prerequisites

Using these APIs is straightforward once you identify a few pieces of information and select your preferred Microsoft Entra ID authentication flow.

### Gathering basic information

To use these APIs, you first need to gather the following pieces of information:

- Your Fabric tenant ID.
    
    The tenant ID is a GUID, and it can be found in the **Profile** card or the ****Help**, **About Fabric** menu in Fabric.

- The workspace and data item ID of the data item (such as a lakehouse) with a top-level Tables directory.

    These IDs are GUIDs. They can be found within the OneLake URL of any table in OneLake. They can alternatively be found within the URL seen in your browser when you have a data item open in Fabric.

- The user or service principal identity in Microsoft Entra ID that has permissions to read tables in your chosen data item.

### Preparing for authentication

1. Decide how you would like to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID to obtain an access token for your chosen Microsoft Entra identity.

    You can [check this guide to learn about the different ways to obtain an access token with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/authentication-flows-app-scenarios). Microsoft offers [convenient authentication libraries in several languages](/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview).

1. If you are developing a new application that will either allow users to sign in or sign in as a standalone application, [register your application with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

1. [Grant API permission](/entra/identity-platform/howto-update-permissions?pivots=portal#option-1-add-permissions-in-the-api-permissions-pane) for the Azure Storage (`https://storage.azure.com/`) token audience, to your Microsoft Entra ID application. Granting this permission ensures that your application can obtain tokens for use with the OneLake table endpoint.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The OneLake table API endpoint accepts the same token audience as the OneLake filesystem endpoints.
    > 
    > If you are developing an application, you might already know how to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID to interact with OneLake filesystem REST APIs. If so, you can use the same approach to authenticate with the new OneLake table endpoint.

## Iceberg REST Catalog (IRC) API operations on OneLake

Learn [how to get started with the OneLake table API endpoint to interact with Iceberg tables in OneLake](./iceberg-table-apis-overview.md). Initially, read-only metadata table operations are supported, and we plan to add more operations soon.

> [!NOTE]
> Before using the Iceberg APIs, be sure you have Delta Lake to Iceberg metadata conversion enabled for your tenant or workspace. Review the [instructions to learn how to enable automatic Delta Lake to Iceberg table format conversion](../onelake-iceberg-tables.md#virtualize-delta-lake-tables-as-iceberg).

## Delta Lake REST API operations on OneLake
