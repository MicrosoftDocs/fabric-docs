# Bring your data to OneLake with Lakehouse

This tutorial is a quick guide to creating a lakehouse and getting started with the basic methods of interacting with it. After completing this tutorial, you'll have a lakehouse provisioned inside of Microsoft Fabric working on top of OneLake.

## Create a lakehouse

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Fabric](https://fabric.microsoft.com/).

1. Switch to Data Engineering using the workload switcher icon at the lower left corner of your homepage.

1. Select **Workspaces** from the left-hand menu.

1. To open your workspace, enter its name in the search textbox located at the top and select it from the search results.

1. In the upper left corner of the workspace home page, select **New** and then choose **Lakehouse**.

1. Give your lakehouse a name and select **Create**.

1. A new lakehouse is created and if this is your first OneLake item, OneLake is provisioned behind the scenes.

At this point, you have a lakehouse running on top of OneLake. Next, add some data and start organizing your lake.

## Load data into a lakehouse

1. In the file browser on the left, select **Files** and then select **New subfolder**. Name your subfolder and select **Create**.

1. You can repeat this step to add more subfolders as needed.

1. Select a folder and the select **Upload files** from the list.

1. Choose the file you want from your local machine and then select **Upload**.

1. You’ve now added data to OneLake. To add data in bulk or schedule data loads into OneLake, use the **Get data** button to create pipelines. Find more details about options for getting data in [Microsoft Fabric decision guide: copy activity, dataflow, or Spark](../get-started/decision-guide-pipeline-dataflow-spark.md).

1. Select the More icon (**…**) for the file you uploaded and select **Properties** from the menu.

   The **Properties** screen shows the various details for the file, including the URL and Azure Blob File System (ABFS) path for use with Notebooks. You can copy the ABFS into a Fabric Notebook to query the data using Spark. To learn more about notebooks in Fabric, see [Explore the data in your lakehouse with a notebook](..\data-engineering\lakehouse-notebook-explore.md).

You've now created your first lakehouse with data stored in OneLake.
