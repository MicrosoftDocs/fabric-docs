# Find your Fabric home region

A Fabric home region is the Azure datacenter region linked to your Fabric tenant, chosen when your tenant was created. Knowing your home region is important for understanding [workload and feature availability](region-availability.md), as well as data residency, performance, and compliance.

To find your Fabric home region, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Fabric.

1. Open the Help pane and choose the **About** link (the text of the link varies depending on which workload is selected).

1. Look for the value next to **Your data is stored in**. The location shown is the default region where your data is stored. You might also be using capacities in different regions for your workspaces.
