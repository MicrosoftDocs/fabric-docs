# Use the Monitoring hub

The Microsoft Fabric *Monitoring hub* enables users to monitor Microsoft Fabric activities from a central location. Any Fabric user can use the monitoring hub, however, the monitoring hub displays activities only for Fabric items you have permission to view.

The monitoring hub displays activities for these Fabric items:

* Data pipelines

* Dataflows

* Datamarts

* Lakehouses

* Notebooks

* Semantic models

* Spark job definitions

## View the monitoring hub display

To open the Monitoring hub, In Fabric, select **Monitoring hub** from the navigation pane. The monitoring hub displays information in a table form. Fabric activities are displayed according to their start time, with the newest activities at the top of the table. Each Fabric item displays a maximum of 100 activities. History is kept for 30 days and can be viewed using the *Historical view* option.
