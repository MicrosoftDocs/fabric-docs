# Fabric command line interface

Microsoft Fabric has a command line interface (CLI) that you can use for a range of Fabric tasks. This article shows how to get the CLI and use it to log into Fabric.

Any Fabric user can use the CLI. The CLI is useful for admins and developers who are comfortable working in a command line interface. You can also use the CLI as a [service principal](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) for automation tasks.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

## Get the CLI

Open *Command Prompt* (cmd) and run the following command to install the CLI.

```python
pip install ms-fabric-cli
```

## Log into Fabric

To log into Fabric, follow these steps:

1. Open *Command Prompt* (cmd).

2. Run the command:

    ```python
    fab auth login
    ```

3. Select the login method using the arrow keys, and then press **Enter**.

    * **Interactive with web browser** - Use this method to log in as a user. You'll be prompted to log in using your browser.
    * **Service principal authentication with secret** - Use this method to log in as a service principal. You'll be prompted to enter your service principal credentials.
    * **Service principal authentication with certificate** - Use this method to log in as a service principal with a certificate. You'll be prompted to select your certificate.
