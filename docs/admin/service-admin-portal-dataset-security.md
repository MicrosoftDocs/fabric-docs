# Semantic model security tenant setting

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Block republish and disable package refresh

Disable package refresh, and only allow the semantic model owner to publish updates.
