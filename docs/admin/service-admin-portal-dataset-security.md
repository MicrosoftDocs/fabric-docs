# Semantic model security tenant setting

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Block republish and disable package refresh

Disable package refresh, and only allow the semantic model owner to publish updates. When using the [XMLA Endpoint](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-connect-tools), a user can discover only those semantic models for which they are the owner.

To learn more about semantic model security, see [Semantic model permissions](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-permissions).
