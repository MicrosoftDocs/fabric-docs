# Fabric region availability

Microsoft Fabric is available in the Azure regions listed in this article. If your Microsoft Fabric home region isn't listed, you can still use Fabric by creating a Fabric capacity in a region where Fabric is available, and then using Fabric's muti-geo capabilities. For more information, see [Multi-Geo support for Fabric](./service-admin-premium-multi-geo.md).

To find out what your Fabric home region is, see [Find your Fabric home region](./find-fabric-home-region.md).

For more information about purchasing a Fabric subscription, see [Buy a Microsoft Fabric subscription](../enterprise/buy-subscription.md).
