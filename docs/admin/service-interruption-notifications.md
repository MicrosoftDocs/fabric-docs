# Service interruption notifications

It's important to have insight into the availability of your mission-critical business applications. Microsoft Fabric incident notification so you can optionally receive emails if there's a service disruption or degradation.

At this time, emails are sent for the following *reliability scenarios*:

- Open report reliability
- Model refresh reliability
- Query refresh reliability

Notifications are sent when there's an *extended delay* in operations like opening reports, semantic model refresh, or query executions. After an incident is resolved, you receive a follow-up email.

## Enable notifications for service outages or incidents

A Fabric admin can enable notifications for service outages or incidents in the admin portal:

1. Identify or create an email-enabled security group that should receive notifications.

1. In the admin portal, select **Tenant settings**. Under **Help and support settings**, expand **Receive email notifications for service outages or incidents**.

1. Enable notifications, enter a security group, and select **Apply**.
