# View refresh summary

The refresh summary admin settings page lets you view your capacity's refresh history. You can also export the refresh history, and view details related to a specific refresh. The information in this page can help you investigate refresh errors, and establish a refresh schedule for the Power BI items that reside on your capacities.

To learn how to access the Fabric admin portal settings, see [What is the admin portal?](admin-center.md)

## Schedule

The schedule tab lists all the refreshes that took place in a specific capacity. Select the capacity you want to review from the *choose a capacity* dropdown menu. Use the *refresh* button to refresh the table's results, and the *export* button to export a .csv file.

To view details for a specific refresh instance, select the instance and then select **Details**.

## History

The history tab lists all the refreshes that took place in all the capacities you're an admin of. The table headers allow you to sort the information and apply filters. Use the *refresh* button to refresh the table's results, and the *export* button to export a .csv file.
