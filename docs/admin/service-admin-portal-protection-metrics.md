# View information protection metrics

After you enable information protection for Power BI, data protection metrics can be displayed in the admin portal. The report shows how sensitivity labels help protect your content.

## Opening the protection metrics report

You must have a Fabric administrator role to open and view the report. To view the report, go to **Settings > Admin portal**, and choose **Protection metrics**. To learn how to access the Fabric admin portal settings, see [What is the admin portal?](admin-center.md)

See [Data protection metrics report](/power-bi/enterprise/service-security-data-protection-metrics-report) for details about the report.
