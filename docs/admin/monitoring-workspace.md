# What is the admin monitoring workspace? (Preview)

The *Admin monitoring* workspace is designed to provide admins with monitoring capabilities for their organization. Using the admin monitoring workspace resources, admins can perform security and governance tasks such as audits and usage checks.

## Prerequisites

To use the admin monitoring workspace, you need to be an admin with one of these roles.

* Microsoft 365 *Global administrator*

* *Fabric administrator*

## Access the admin monitoring workspace

The admin monitoring workspace is enabled for [Microsoft Fabric admins](microsoft-fabric-admin.md) that have the *Global administrator* or *Fabric administrator* role. Admins can also share its content with other users. Users with viewer permissions that aren't admins, can view the admin monitoring workspace by navigating to the workspace URL.

### Admin monitoring workspace view

Only admins with the *Global administrator* or *Fabric administrator* roles, can see the admin monitoring workspace at the top of their list of workspaces. Admins can access the monitoring workspace by selecting it from the list.

Users that aren't admins, and don't have a *Global administrator* or *Fabric administrator* role, can't see the admin monitoring workspace at the top of their list of workspaces. Such users can only view the admin monitoring workspace by navigating to it's URL after they've been given viewer permissions by an admin.

### Installing the admin monitoring workspace

The admin monitoring workspace is automatically installed during the first time any Microsoft Fabric admin accesses it. To access the admin monitoring workspace, follow these steps:

1. Log into Microsoft Fabric with your account.

2. From the left pane, select **Workspaces**.

3. Select **Admin monitoring**. When you select this option for the first time, the required items are automatically installed.

## Reports and semantic models

You can use the reports in the monitoring workspace as is, for analysis and for getting insights about performance and sharing in your organization. You can also connect to the semantic models of the reports, and create a solution that's optimized for your organization.

### Manage access

There are several ways you can manage access to content of the admin monitoring workspace. If you're the admin of the workspace, you have a *member* workspace role and you can grant access to any of its items with or without share and build permissions.

* **Workspace** - Learn how to to give users access to the workspace in [manage workspace](portal-workspaces.md). You can only grant other users a viewer role. Once a viewer role is provided, it can't be taken away.

* **Report** - You can [share a report](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-share) with other users.

* **Semantic model** - You can [share access to a semantic model](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-share) with other users. Once a semantic model is shared, you can't unshare it.

### Refreshes

The admin monitoring workspace is automatically refreshed once a day. The refresh takes place about 10 minutes after the admin workspace was accessed for the first time.

For the refresh to work, the admin that accessed the workspace for the first time, has to:

* Keep his *Global administrator* or *Fabric administrator* role. If the role of the admin who first accessed the workspace changes, the admin monitoring workspace won't be refreshed.

* If the workspace creator uses [Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure), it has to be enabled during the scheduled refresh.

## Considerations and limitations

* The admin monitoring workspace can only be created by a user that is an admin for the tenant. This user needs to be assigned as an admin to the tenant directly. Users that belong to a group that's assigned as an admin to the tenant, can't create the admin monitoring workspace.

* The admin monitoring workspace is a read-only workspace. [Workspace roles](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces#workspace-roles) don't have the same capabilities as they do in other workspaces. Users, including admins, aren't able to edit or view properties of items such as semantic models and reports in the workspace.

* Sovereign clouds aren't supported.

* Users granted *build* permissions to a semantic model in the monitoring workspace, show as having *read* permissions.

* [Granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/gdap-introduction) aren't supported.
