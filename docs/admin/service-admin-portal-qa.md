# Q&A tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Review questions

When this setting is enabled, semantic model owners can review questions end-users ask about their data.

To learn more, see [Intro to Q&A tooling to train Power BI Q&A](/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-tooling-intro).

## Synonym sharing

When this setting is enabled, users can share Q&A synonyms as suggested terms with everyone in your organization.

To learn about synonyms, see [Field synonyms](/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-tooling-intro#field-synonyms).

> [!NOTE]
> If you disable this setting and apply the changes, and then later re-enable synonym sharing, it might take a few weeks to reshare all the synonyms within your organization.
