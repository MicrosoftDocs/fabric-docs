# User experience experiments tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Help Power BI optimize your experience

Enabling this feature allows the Power BI team to gather early feedback and to make data-driven decisions as to which in-product experience is received more positively by users.

When this feature is enabled, individual users in the same organization might get minor variations in the user experience, including content, layout, and design, before these variations go live for all users. This means that different users in the same tenant might have slightly different experiences.
