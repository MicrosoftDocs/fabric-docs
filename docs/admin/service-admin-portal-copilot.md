# Copilot tenant settings

Fabric has a new tenant setting group, **Copilot and Azure OpenAI Service**, with following two settings:

- Admins can turn on Copilot for specific security groups, or for their entire organization. Users in those groups can use a preview of Copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI.

- Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be processed outside your capacity's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance.

By default, the **Tenant settings** for Fabric OpenAI are disabled. Ask your tenant admins to enable them if they're willing and allowed to use the features powered by Azure OpenAI.
