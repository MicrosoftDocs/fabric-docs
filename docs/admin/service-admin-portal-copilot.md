# Copilot tenant settings

Copilot and the Azure OpenAI Service are controlled by settings in the **Copilot and Azure OpenAI Service** tenant settings group.​ The tenant settings for Fabric Copilot are enabled by default.

## Users can use Copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI

When this setting is enabled, users can access the features powered by Azure OpenAI, including Copilot. This setting can be managed at both the tenant and the capacity levels. For more information, see [Overview of Copilot in Fabric](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview).

## Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be processed outside your capacity's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance

This setting is only applicable for customers who want to use Copilot and AI features in Fabric powered by Azure OpenAI, and whose capacity's geographic region is outside of the EU data boundary and the US.
