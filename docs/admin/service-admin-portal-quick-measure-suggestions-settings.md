# Quick measure suggestions tenant settings 

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Allow quick measure suggestions (preview)

When enabled, users use natural language to generate suggested measures. Quick measure suggestions assist creation of DAX measures using natural language instead of using templates or writing DAX from scratch.

To learn more, see [Quick measure suggestions](/power-bi/transform-model/quick-measure-suggestions).

## Allow user data to leave their geography

Quick measure suggestions are currently processed in the US. When this setting is enabled, users get quick measure suggestions for data outside the US. 

To learn more, see [Limitations and considerations](/power-bi/transform-model/quick-measure-suggestions#limitations-and-considerations).
