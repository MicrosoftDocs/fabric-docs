# Manage featured content

If the *featured content* feature is enabled in your organization, users can feature content in the **Featured** section of the Power BI Home page. See [Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home page](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-featured-content) for details.

As a Fabric admin, you can monitor this featured content and remove it from the **Featured** section, if necessary. You can also disable the featured content feature entirely, in which case users will no longer be able to feature content. See the [Enable/disable featured content](#enabledisable-featured-content) section.

## Monitor and manage featured content

In the [admin portal](admin-center.md), select **Featured content**.

Here you see a list of all featured items along with their relevant metadata. If something looks suspicious, or you want to clean up the **Featured** section, you can delete featured items as needed.

To delete an item, mouse over and select the item, and then click the trash can that appears in the top ribbon, or choose **More options (...) > Delete**. It's possible to select multiple items and then delete.

## Enable/disable featured content

The featured content feature is enabled, disabled, and configured (for example, specifying who can feature content) via an admin setting. To learn more, see [Featured content](service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#featured-content).
