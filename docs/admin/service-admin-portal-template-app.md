# Template app tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Publish template apps

Users in the organization can create template apps workspaces. Control which users can publish template apps or distribute them to clients outside your organization by way of [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) or other distribution methods.
