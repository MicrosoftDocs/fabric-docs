# App tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md).

## Create template organizational apps

Users in the organization can create template apps that use semantic models built on one data source in Power BI Desktop.

To learn more, see [Create a template app in Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/service-template-apps-create).

## Push apps to end users

Admins can allow report creators to share apps directly with end users, without requiring installation from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). In the admin portal, the setting is **Push apps to end users**.

To learn more, see [Automatically install apps for end users](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps#automatically-install-apps-for-end-users).

## Publish apps to the entire organization

Admins use this setting to decide which users can publish apps to the entire organization, rather than specific groups. The following image shows the **Entire organization** option when creating an app.
