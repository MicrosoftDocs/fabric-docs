## Considerations and limitations

When capacity ID and capacity name aren't available in the audit logs, you can view them in the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](../enterprise/metrics-app.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Starting July 7, 2025**, As part of our ongoing efforts to simplify audit logging and ensure consistency across Microsoft Fabric, we're **standardizing redundant artifact operations** into a single set of unified operations. This migration aligns Datamart, Warehouse, and SQL Analytics Endpoint Lakehouse actions under common names used across the Fabric platform.
