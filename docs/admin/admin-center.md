# What is the admin center?

The Microsoft Fabric admin center, previously known as the [admin portal](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal), includes settings that govern Microsoft Fabric. For example, you can make changes to [tenant settings](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings), access the Microsoft 365 admin center, and control how users interact with Microsoft Fabric.

The admin center can be accessed by global and Microsoft Fabric admins. If you're not in one of these roles, you only see *Capacity settings* in the admin center.
