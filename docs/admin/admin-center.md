# What is the admin portal?

The Microsoft Fabric admin portal includes settings that govern Microsoft Fabric. For example, you can make changes to [tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md), access the Microsoft 365 admin portal, and control how users interact with Microsoft Fabric.

To access the admin portal, you need a [Fabric license](../enterprise/licenses.md#per-user-licenses) and the *Fabric administrator* role.

If you're not in one of these roles, you only see *Capacity settings* in the admin portal.

## What can I do in the admin portal

The many controls in the admin portal are listed in the following table, with links to relevant documentation for each one.
