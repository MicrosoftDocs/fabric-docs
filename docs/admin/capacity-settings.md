## View your capacity

The capacity settings page shows a list of all the capacities in your [tenant](../enterprise/licenses.md#tenant). At the top of the page you can see a list of the different Fabric capacity types. Select a capacity type to view all the capacities of that type in your tenant.

* **Power BI Premium** - A capacity that was bought as part of a Power BI Premium subscription. These capacities use P SKUs.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Power BI capacities are transitioning to Fabric. For more information, see [Power BI Premium transition to Microsoft Fabric](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-faq#power-bi-premium-transition-to-microsoft-fabric).
