# Govern Fabric data

The Govern tab in the OneLake catalog enables you to assess, enhance, and oversee the governance status of the data you manage throughout Fabric. It brings everything together in a single location:
* [Insights](#get-insights-about-the-governance-status) that help you understand the governance status of data and identify areas for improvement.
* [Recommended actions](#take-actions-to-improve-the-governance-posture) you can take to improve data's governance posture. The recommended actions are accompanied by guidance to help you accomplish them.
* [Links to tools and learning resources](#get-help-with-your-data-governance-efforts) you can use to help you analyze, improve, and maintain the governance of the data in Fabric.

As a Fabric admin, the insights you see on the Govern tab are based on the entire tenant metadata, from items through workspaces to capacities and domains (see [Considerations and limitations for exceptions](#considerations-and-limitations)).

As a data owner, the insights you see are based on all the items in Fabric that you own. These items appear when you apply the **My items** filter on the [explore tab](./onelake-catalog-explore.md) (see [Considerations and limitations for exceptions](#considerations-and-limitations)).

To get to the Govern tab, select the [OneLake catalog icon in the Fabric navigation pane](./onelake-catalog-overview.md) and then select **Govern**.

You can also access from the settings gear by selecting the **OneLake Catalog | Govern** link.

## Governance information 

The first time you open the Govern tab, it might take a few moments for the insights and actions to appear.

When Fabric Admins access the Govern tab, they see **All Data in Fabric** by default. They can switch to view their own items' governance states by selecting **My items**.

Data owners see their own items view by default.

## Scope the insights and recommended actions by domain

If your organization has defined domains, you can use the OneLake catalog's [domain selector](./onelake-catalog-explore.md#scope-the-catalog-to-a-particular-domain) to choose a specific domain or subdomain. Doing so scopes the insights and recommended actions to items that reside within the selected domain.

:::image type="content" source="./media/onelake-catalog-govern/onelake-catalog-govern-domains-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select a domain in the OneLake catalog." lightbox="./media/onelake-catalog-govern/onelake-catalog-govern-domains-selector.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> For Fabric admins, the domain filter doesn't apply to certain actions and those actions remain unchanged.

## Get insights about the governance status 

For Fabric admins, the insights section provides high-level insights about the entire Fabric tenant. You can select **View more** to see [all available insights](#all-insights).

The data in these insights is based on the last successful refresh of the Admin Monitoring Storage that was automatically generated in the Admin Monitoring workspace the first time an admin opened the Govern tab or accessed the Admin Monitoring workspace. The data refreshes automatically every day. (See [Considerations and limitations for exceptions](#considerations-and-limitations).)

For data owners, and as part of My Items view, the insights section provides basic high-level insights about the content you've created in Fabric. You can select **View more** to see [all available insights](#all-insights).

The data in these insights is based on the last successful refresh of your OneLake catalog governance report. The data refreshes automatically every time you open the Govern tab. You can also select the Refresh button if you want to make sure you have the latest data.

## All insights

Selecting **View more** gives Fabric admins access to expanded insights across three tabs:

* **Manage your data estate** contains inventory overview, capacities & domains information and details about feature usage across the tenant. 

* **Protect, secure & comply** includes information about sensitivity label coverage and data loss prevention policies activated and scanned across the various workspaces in the organization.

* **Discover, trust, and reuse** surfaces insights about data freshness, item curation state with information about description &endorsement coverage and content sharing view.

Data owners see a simplified report with more insights about their inventory, sensitivity label coverage, and curation state. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/onelake-catalog-govern/OneLake-catalog-govern-view-more-data-owners.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the view more report for data owners." lightbox="./media/onelake-catalog-govern/OneLake-catalog-govern-view-more-data-owners.png":::

In both reports, you can filter, drill through to get more details and initiate Copilot at any point to gain more insights and support comprehensive, interactive data exploration (see [Considerations and limitations for exceptions](#considerations-and-limitations)).

## Take actions to improve the governance posture

The recommended actions section displays cards suggesting actions you can take to improve the governance posture of the data. When you select a card, you see an insight highlighting the issue, an explanation of why the issue revealed by the insight matters, and a list of steps about how to address the issue.

Recommended actions for Fabric admins:

Recommended actions for data owners: 

:::image type="content" source="./media/onelake-catalog-govern/onelake-catalog-govern-tab-recommended-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the recommended action section for data owners." lightbox="./media/onelake-catalog-govern/onelake-catalog-govern-tab-recommended-actions.png":::

The recommended actions vary depending on what the insights reveal.

## Get help with your data governance efforts

The Govern tab provides links to tools and resources relevant to your scope of responsibility:

  **Top solutions**: Lists relevant Microsoft Fabric solutions for data governance, compliance, and security, along with links to documentation.

  **Read, watch, and learn** Provides links to other relevant documentation and resources.


## Create custom reports

If you wish to customize the report, either create a copy of the report and then modify the copy, or create a new report based on the autogenerated semantic model. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do not** under any circumstances modify the original autogenerated report or semantic model. They're required for the proper functioning of the Govern tab's insights, and any changes you make to these items can cause the insights to cease working properly.

## Troubleshooting

If *admin monitoring workspace* or *My workspaces* are reassigned to another capacity, users could get an error when accessing the Govern tab in the OneLake Catalog. In such cases, ensure the newly assigned capacity has enough resources to run the semantic models and reports or try to reallocate the workspaces to another capacity.

For the *My items* view, if the data isn't refreshing as expected, check the notifications pane and the Monitor page to see if you can identify the cause. If refresh fails repeatedly, or if you can't figure out what's causing it to fail, try regenerating the report. To do so, close the Govern tab, and delete the OneLake catalog governance report and its associated semantic model from your My workspaces. Then reopen the Govern tab.

## Considerations and limitations

* Subitems, such as tables, aren't supported and don't surface into the insights.
* The Govern tab doesn't support cross-tenant scenarios or guest users
* The Govern tab isn't available when Private Link is activated.
* Copilot functionality depends on organizational setup and the capacity the workspace is assigned with. The workspace (*admin monitoring workspace* for the admin view and *My workspaces* for the data owners view) should be allocated to the appropriate capacity in order to activate the Copilot button.
* As Admins insights, recommended actions, and view more reports are based on admin monitoring storage that refreshes once a day, there could be gaps between the data reflected and the actual state. It takes a day to get an updated view of all the changes made in the organization.
* If *admin monitoring workspace* or *My workspaces* are reassigned to another capacity, users could get an error when accessing the Govern tab in the OneLake Catalog. In such cases, ensure the newly assigned capacity has enough resources to run the semantic models and reports.
