# Accept an external data share

When someone invites you to share OneLake data from their organization, you receive a link that you can use to accept the invitation and to create a shortcut to the shared data in a Fabric item of your choosing. You have 90 days to accept the invitation.

## Prerequisites

To be able to accept and use an external data share, you need standard Fabric write and reshare permissions on the lakehouse or KQL database item where you want to create the shortcut to the shared data. That item must have at least one folder or table.

## Accept a share

To accept a share:

1. Select the share link or paste the URL in a browser. This navigates you to a dialog that displays the name of the share and the details of the data provider's tenant.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > The link only works for users who aren't in the tenant where the shared data is stored. If you're in the sharing tenant, contact the person who sent you the link and ask them to share with you using a OneLake shortcut instead. For more information, see [How does external data sharing work](./external-data-sharing-overview.md#how-does-external-data-sharing-work).

1. Select **Accept and select a location**. This opens the OneLake data hub. Select a lakehouse, select **Next**, select the table or folder location in which to create the incoming share shortcut, and then select **Apply**.

    The share has now been created in your OneLake location. The data within this share location can be consumed using any Fabric workload in your tenant.

## Security considerations

Using data shared from another tenant has important implications for data security and privacy. See [Security considerations](./external-data-sharing-overview.md#security-considerations) for detail.
