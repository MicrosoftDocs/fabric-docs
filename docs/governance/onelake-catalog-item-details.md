# View item details in the OneLake catalog

The item details page in the **OneLake catalog** explorer provides a comprehensive view of each item, including an item's metadata, lineage, permissions, and more. This page is designed to help users find, explore, and use items effectively across their organization.

The item details view includes several tabs that help you explore and manage the selected item. It's especially useful for:

  * **Item owners**: Manage permissions, view refresh history, and track lineage to monitor and manage items.
  * **Developers and Analysts**: Access trust signals for an item, identify high-quality data to use as starting points, and avoid creating redundant items.
  * **Consumers**: Discover reliable apps, reports, and dashboards to support everyday work.

The item details page adapts to how you access it, offering two convenient ways to explore items:

* **In-context view**: When you click on an item's name in OneLake catalog explorer, its details appear as a pane next to your current filtered list of items. This allows you to seamlessly explore and compare items, helping you find the most suitable one. You can expand this pane for a full-page view, then retract or close it to return to your full list.
* **Full-page view**: If you open an item's details from outside the Catalog, for example by selecting "View Details" from an item's context menu in Workspaces, or by using a direct URL, the page opens in full-screen. This gives you a dedicated, comprehensive view of that single item. Since you're not coming from a filtered list in the Catalog, you won't see other items alongside it. To browse for other items, just select the OneLake Catalog entry point in the left navigation.

## About the item details view

The item details page features multiple tabs that vary by item type (for example, semantic model, dataflow, or pipeline), each providing relevant information and functionality. This article describes each tab, its contents, and the actions you can perform on the item details page.

### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab is the default view when you open an item in the OneLake catalog explorer. It shows the following information about the selected item:

  * **Description**: The description associated with the item, displayed under the item name. A useful and meaningful description helps users discover the right item for them.
  * **Location**: The workspace where the item is located. Selecting the workspace navigates to the workspace.
  * **Refreshed**: The last time the item was refreshed or run. A red warning icon appears if the last update was unsuccessful. Selecting the icon displays the error details. 
  * **Owner**: Displays the item owner or [contact](/power-bi/create-reports/service-item-contact). Selecting the name opens an email to them.
  * **Sensitivity label**: If applied, the name of the [sensitivity label](protected-sensitivity-labels.md) associated with the item.
  * **Tags**: If applied, the list of [tags](tags-overview.md) associated with the item.
  * **Endorsement**: [Endorsement](endorsement-overview.md) status and the details of the endorsing user. Endorsing your item (promoting or certifying it) makes it easier for users to find and signifies it's a trustworthy data source.

### Data schema in the Tables section

For data items like semantic models and lakehouses, the **Tables** section displays a structured view of the underlying table and column schema for the item.

  * Use the **Filter by keyword** box to search for a specific table or column.
  * To explore data in a table or column, point to it and select the binoculars icon. The [Explore this data](/power-bi/consumer/explore-data-service) view opens, which displays the data for ad-hoc analysis.

### Details about semantic models

In the OneLake catalog explorer, you can view and interact with semantic models based on your permissions and whether the model is set to be discoverable.

  * **Discoverable**: These are semantic models that have been made [discoverable](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) by their owner. Discoverable semantic models make it easier for users across the organization to find relevant data assets. While you can see the semantic model and its metadata, you can't see the owner details, view underlying data, or build content on top of the semantic model. You need to **request access** (Build permission) to access the semantic model's full information and capabilities.
  * **Read-only Permission**: If someone shares a report or semantic model with you but doesnâ€™t grant Build [permission](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-permissions), you might have read-only access, which limits your ability to view and interact with the semantic model. To create content or perform more actions, you need at least Build permission.
  * **Build Permission**: If you have [Build permission](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions) on a semantic model, you can create new reports based on it, connect to it from Excel, and export its data.

### Lineage tab

The **Lineage** tab shows the item's upstream and downstream relationships. It also shows metadata associated with the item, including location, endorsement, and sensitivity information. You can view this lineage in either a list or a graph format.

:::image type="content" source="./media/onelake-catalog-item-details/onelake-catalog-explore-lineage-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the explore tab item view lineage tab." lightbox="./media/onelake-catalog-item-details/onelake-catalog-explore-lineage-tab.png":::

The graph view provides a visual representation of the relationships between the current item and its related items. Each related item is shown as a card containing key metadata, with the current item highlighted for context.

For more information, see [Lineage in Fabric](lineage.md).

### Monitor tab

The **Monitor** tab displays historical activities for the item. Select **Show** for a record to see the details about that activity. The **Monitor** tab is available for item types supported by the [monitor hub](/admin/monitoring-hub.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/onelake-catalog-item-details/onelake-catalog-explore-monitor-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the explore tab item view monitor tab." lightbox="./media/onelake-catalog-item-details/onelake-catalog-explore-monitor-tab.png":::

### Permissions tab

The **Permissions** tab is available to you if you're a member of the Admin or Member workspace roles. It shows who has direct access to the item, any links that grant access, related items that provide inherited access, and any pending access requests. From this tab, you can manage user permissions, audit or remove access links, and approve or deny access requests.

The subtabs available on the **Permissions** tab vary slightly depending on the item type. To see the available actions for a specific row in any subtab, point to the row and select **More options (...)**.

You can use the filter to refine your search.

## Available actions in the item details view

From within the item details page, you can perform a range of actions on an item based on its type and your permissions. The available actions are grouped into general actions that apply to all item types, and item-specific actions that are unique to data or process items.

### General Actions

General actions are universally available across all item types in OneLake catalog explorer. Your access to these actions is based on your permissions.

These actions are available in:

  * The item's context menu (three dots icon), which is available when you point to an item in the list.
  * The item's details page, which opens when you select an item in the list.

### Item-specific actions

Item-specific actions are unique to particular artifact types, providing specialized functionality. They're categorized by whether the item is primarily a data source or a processing artifact.

These actions are available in:

  * The item's context menu (three dots icon), which is available when you point to an item in the list.
  * The item's details page, which opens when you select an item in the list.

## Considerations and limitations

  * Real-time semantic models don't have a details page, as they're being [retired](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-the-retirement-of-real-time-streaming-in-power-bi/).
