# The Microsoft Purview hub in Microsoft Fabric (preview)

Microsoft Purview hub is a centralized page in Fabric that helps Fabric administrators and users manage and govern their Fabric data estate. It contains reports that provide insights about sensitive data and item endorsement, and also serves as a gateway to more advanced capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance and compliance portals such as Data Catalog, Information Protection, Data Loss Prevention, and Audit.

> [!NOTE]
> In this document, *Fabric administrators* refers to users who have the [Fabric administrator role](../admin/roles.md) or higher.

The Purview hub has a view for Fabric administrators and a view for other (nonadmin) Fabric users.
* Fabric administrators see insights concerning their organization's entire Fabric data estate. They also see links to capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance and compliance portals to help them further analyze and manage governance of their organization's Fabric data.
* Other users see insights about their own Fabric content and links to capabilities in the Microsoft Purview governance portal that help them further explore their data.

When you open the hub, the appropriate view opens. In the sections below, select the appropriate tab to see the information that is relevant to you.

## Access the hub

To access the hub, open the Fabric settings pane and choose **Microsoft Purview hub**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/use-microsoft-purview-hub/open-purview-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Purview hub link in Fabric settings.":::

When you select the Microsoft Purview hub option, the hub opens to the view that is appropriate for you, and insights are generated. If this is the first time insights are being generated, it might take some time for them to appear.

>[!NOTE]
> If you're not a Fabric administrator and you don't own or haven't created any content, the hub won't contain any insights.
>
> For some users, the hub won't open at all when they select the **Microsoft Purview hub** option. See [Considerations and limitations for more detail about this exceptions](#considerations-and-limitations).

## Get insights about your Microsoft Fabric data

# [Fabric admins](#tab/admin-view)

Use the Microsoft Fabric data section of the hub to see insights about your Fabric data. These insights cover your organization's entire Fabric data estate - that is, all Fabric items, both data and nondata items, of all the users in the organization. Two reports help you analyze the data.

* The **Items** report shows you insights about your organization's Fabric items - how many there are, what kinds they are, how many are promoted or certified, how these promoted and certified items are distributed throughout the workspaces, etc. Such insights might be used to drive adoption of certification in workspaces.

* The **Sensitivity** report shows you insights about the sensitivity labeling of your organization's Fabric items. You can see label coverage by workspace and by item type, you can see the ratio of labeled versus unlabeled items, and you can see which labels are used most.

The visuals in the reports are interactive, and you can select items and drill down to get deeper insights into the endorsement and sensitivity label coverage of your data. For instance, you could filter on a workspace to see what items are in the workspace and how many of them are certified or promoted, or you can identify workspaces that have the greatest number of items with no sensitivity label, so that you could reach out to the data owners and ask them to take action.

# [Other users](#tab/data-owner-view)

Use the Microsoft Fabric data section of the hub to see insights about your Fabric data. These insights cover the Fabric data items that you own. Two reports help you analyze the data.

* The **Items** tab shows you insights about your Fabric items - how many there are, what kinds they are, how many are promoted or certified, how these promoted and certified items are distributed throughout the workspaces, etc.

* The **Sensitivity** tab shows you insights about the sensitivity labeling of your Fabric items. You can see label coverage by workspace and by item type, you can see the ratio of labeled versus unlabeled items, and you can see which labels are used most.

The visuals in the reports are interactive, and you can select items and drill down to get deeper insights into the endorsement and sensitivity label coverage of your data. For instance, you could filter on a workspace to see what items are in the workspace and how many of them are certified or promoted, or you can identify workspaces that have the greatest number of items with no sensitivity label. Such insights can help you with your data governance efforts.
