> [!Warning]
> Revoking an external data share is a serious matter that should be considered carefully and in consultation with the receiving tenant. It completely and irreversibly severs all access from the receiving tenant to the shared data. This means that any and all data artifacts built in the receiving tenant on the basis of the shared data will cease to function. A revoked external data share can't be restored. A new external data share can be created, but all work done in the receiving tenant based on the revoked share will have to be rebuilt from scratch..
