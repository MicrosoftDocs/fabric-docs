# Known issue - Copilot sidecar chat fails with certain private link settings

Copilot sidecar chat when you enable private link on your Fabric tenant and disabled public network access.

**Status:** Fixed: May 9, 2025

**Product Experience:** Databases

## Symptoms

If you enable private link on your Fabric tenant and disable public network access, the Copilot sidecar chat fails with an error. The error message is similar to: `"I'm sorry, but I encountered an error while answering your question. Please try again.`" when you submit any prompts. However, Copilot inline code completion and quick actions still work as expected.
