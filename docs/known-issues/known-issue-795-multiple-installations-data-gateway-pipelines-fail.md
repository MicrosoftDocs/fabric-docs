# Known issue - Multiple installations of on-premises data gateway causes pipelines to fail

You might face an issue with Data Factory pipelines when performing multiple installations on the on-premises data gateway. The issue occurs when you install the on-premises data gateway that supports pipelines, and then downgrade the on-premises data gateway version to a version that doesn't support pipelines. Finally, you upgrade the on-premises data gateway version to support pipelines. You then receive an error when you run a Data Factory pipeline using the on-premises data gateway.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Data Factory

## Symptoms

You receive an error during a pipeline run. The error message is similar to: `Please check your network connectivity to ensure your on-premises data gateway can access xx.frontend.clouddatahub.net`.

## Solutions and workarounds

To solve the issue, uninstall and reinstall the on-premises data gateway.
