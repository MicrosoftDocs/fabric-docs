# Known issue - Sync content from Git in workspace fails

You can connect your workspace to Git and perform a sync from Git into the workspace. When you choose the **Sync content from Git into this workspace** and select the **Sync** button, you receive an error and the sync fails.

**Status:** Fixed: February 20, 2025

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

The error typically happens when you try to sync from a new workspace that wasn't previously synced. It also might happen due to an object with an invalid format. You receive a message similar to: `Theirs artifact must have the same logical id as Yours artifact at this point`, and can't perform any operations using Git.

## Solutions and workarounds

As a workaround for a small workspace, you can fix the problem directly in Git or rename the items.
