# Known issue - Data warehouses don't show button friendly names

The data warehouse user interface might not show the correct button names. You can still use button functionality as expected.

**Status:** Fixed: March 21, 2025

**Product Experience:** Data Warehouse

## Symptoms

If you face this issue, your language might be set to something other than English. When working in the data warehouse experience, you don't see the button friendly names. For example, when you try to create a data warehouse, you see **common.create** instead of **Create** and **common.cancel** instead of **Cancel**.

## Solutions and workarounds

The incorrect names don't affect the button functionality. However, if you want to see the button friendly names, you can append &language=en to the end of your browser URL.
