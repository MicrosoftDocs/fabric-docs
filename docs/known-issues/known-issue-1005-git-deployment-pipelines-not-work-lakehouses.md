# Known issue - Git operations and deployment pipelines don't work with lakehouses

You can't use Git operations or deployment pipelines that require lakehouse items.

**Status:** Fixed: February 4, 2025

**Product Experience:** Data Engineering

## Symptoms

You can't sync your workspace to Git, commit to Git, or update from Git. Also, you can't perform deployments using a deployment pipeline for lakehouse items.

## Solutions and workarounds

As a temporary workaround for deployment pipelines, you can skip the lakehouse by selecting other items. The deployment proceeds for all items except the lakehouse. There's no workaround if you're using a lakehouse in Git operations. This article will be updated when the fix is released.
