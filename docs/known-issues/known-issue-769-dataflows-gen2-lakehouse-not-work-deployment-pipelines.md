# Known issue - Dataflows Gen2 staging lakehouse doesn't work in deployment pipelines

You can use Git integration for your Dataflow Gen2 dataflows. When you begin to commit the workspace to the Git repo, you see the dataflow's staging lakehouse, named **DataflowsStagingLakehouse**, available to commit. While you can select the staging lakehouse to be exported, the integration doesn't work properly. If using a deployment pipeline, you can't deploy **DataflowsStagingLakehouse** to the next stage.
