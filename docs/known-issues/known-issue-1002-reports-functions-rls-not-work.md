# Known issue - Reports that use functions with RLS don't work

You can define row-level security (RLS) for a table that contains measures. `USERELATIONSHIP()` and `CROSSFILTER()` functions can't be used in the measures. A change was recently made to enforce this requirement.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

When viewing a report, you see an error message. The error message is similar to: "`Error fetching data for this Visual. The UseRelationship() and Crossfilter() functions may not be used when querying <dataset> because it is constrained by row level security`" or "`The USERELATIONSHIP() and CROSSFILTER() functions may not be used when querying 'T' because it is constrained by row-level security`."

## Solutions and workarounds

The change is to enforce a security requirement. To prevent your reports from failing, you can remove `USERELATIONSHIP()` and `CROSSFILTER()` from your measures. Alternatively, you can modify the relationships using [recommendations for RLS models](/power-bi/guidance/relationships-active-inactive).
