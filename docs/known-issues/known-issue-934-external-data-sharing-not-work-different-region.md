# Known issue - External data sharing doesn't work in a different region capacity lakehouse

When you accept an external data share invitation, you can select the lakehouse where the external share to the shared data is created. If you select a lakehouse within a capacity that resides in a different region than your home tenant region, the operation fails.

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

After selecting the lakehouse and the path where to create the external share to the external data, the operation fails.
