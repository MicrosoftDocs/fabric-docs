# Known issue - Data pipeline connection fails after connection creator role is removed

You might face issues with a connection in a data pipeline in a certain scenario. The scenario is that you add yourself to the connection creator role in an on-premises data gateway. You then create a connection in a data pipeline successfully. Someone removes you from the content creator role. When you try to add and test the same connection, the connection fails, and you receive an error.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Data Factory

## Symptoms
