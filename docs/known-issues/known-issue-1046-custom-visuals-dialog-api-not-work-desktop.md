# Known issue - Custom visuals using dialog or download API don't work in February Desktop

You can create a custom visual that uses the dialog API, which is the API for showing modal dialogs from custom visuals, or the download API. If you use the custom visual, it doesn't work in the February version of Power BI Desktop (Version: 2.140.1078.0).

**Status:** Fixed: March 10, 2025

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

If you try to open a custom visual that uses the dialog or download API, the dialog doesn't open. The issue only happens in the Desktop, not in the Service.

## Solutions and workarounds

The latest version of Power BI Desktop includes the fix to the known issue. If you're a Microsoft Store customer, you get the new version automatically. If you're a Download Center customer, you can download the new version (Version: 2.140.1454.0).
