# Known issue - Git integration undo action appears after initial sync fails

For this known issue, you shouldn't use the **Undo** button after an initial sync with Git fails. When you initially connect your workspace to a Git repository, the initial sync fails. You wrongly see the option to undo the changes. As warned, workspace items might be deleted if you continue with the **Undo** action. The deleted items might not have a corresponding instance in the Git repository.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Administration & Management

## Symptoms

Here are the steps that must happen for you to see the known issue:

1. You connect a workspace to a Git repository.
1. An initial sync to the Git repository runs and fails.
1. Wrongly, the service doesn't disable the **Undo** operation and lets you choose the **Undo** button.
