# Known issue - Intermittent refresh failure through on-premises data gateway

You might experience intermittent refresh failures for semantic models and dataflows through the on-premises data gateway. Failures happen regardless of how the refresh was triggered, whether scheduled, manually, or over the REST API.

**Status:** Fixed: March 21, 2025

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

You see a gateway-bound refresh fail intermittently with the error `AdoNetProviderOpenConnectionTimeoutError`. Impacted hosts include Power BI semantic models and dataflows. The error occurs when the refresh is scheduled, manual, and via the API.

## Solutions and workarounds

As a workaround, you can try to reboot your on-premises data gateway server or upgrade the server to the latest version.
