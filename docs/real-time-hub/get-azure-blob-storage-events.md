# Get Azure Blob Storage events into Real-Time hub (preview)
This article describes how to get Azure Blob Storage events into Fabric Real-Time hub. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](./includes/preview-note.md)]

An event is the smallest amount of information that fully describes something has happened in a system. Azure Blob Storage events are triggered when a client creates, replaces, deletes a blob, etc. By using the Real-Time hub, you can convert these events into continuous data streams and transform them before routing them to various destinations in Fabric. 

The following Blob Storage event types are supported:

|Event name|Description|
|-------|------------|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated|Triggered when a blob is created or replaced.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted                    |Triggered when a blob is deleted.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed                    |Triggered when a blob is renamed.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobTierChanged                |Triggered when the blob access tier is changed.|
|Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryCreated               |Triggered when a directory is created.|
|Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryRenamed               |Triggered when a directory is renamed.|
|Microsoft.Storage.AsyncOperationInitiated        |Triggered when an operation involving moving or copying data from the archive to hot or cool tiers is initiated.|
|Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryDeleted               |Triggered when a directory is deleted.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobInventoryPolicyCompleted   |Triggered when the inventory run completes for a rule that defines an inventory policy.|
|Microsoft.Storage.LifecyclePolicyCompleted       |Triggered when the actions defined by a lifecycle management policy are done.|

For more information about available event types, see [Azure Blob Storage as Event Grid source](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-blob-storage).

> [!NOTE]
> Consuming Fabric events via eventstream isn't supported if the capacity region of the eventstream is in the following regions: Germany West Central, South-Central US, West US2, West US3 or West Europe. 

## Prerequisites 

- Get access to the Fabric **premium** workspace with **Contributor** or above permissions. 
- An Azure Blob Storage account of kind **StorageV2** (general purpose v2), Block Blob Storage, or Blob Storage. General purpose v1 storage accounts aren't supported. 

## Create streams for Azure Blob Storage events
You can create streams for Azure Blob Storage events in Real-Time hub using one of the ways:

- [Using the **Get events** experience](#launch-get-events-experience)
- [Using the **Fabric events** tab](#fabric-events-tab)


[!INCLUDE [launch-get-events-experience](./includes/launch-get-events-experience.md)]

Now, use instructions from the [Configure and create an eventstream](#configure-and-create-an-eventstream) section.

## Fabric events tab

1. In Real-Time hub, switch to the **Fabric events** tab. 
1. Move the mouse over **Azure Blob Storage**, and select the **Create stream** link or select ... (ellipsis) and then select **Create stream**.

    Now, use instructions from the [Configure and create an eventstream](#configure-and-create-an-eventstream) section, but skip the first step of using the **Get events** page. 

## Configure and create an eventstream

1. On the **Get events** page, select **Azure Blob Storage events**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-azure-blob-storage-events/select-azure-blob-storage-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Get events page with Azure Blob Storage events selected.":::
1. On the **Connect** page, select the **Azure subscription** that has the storage account
1. Select the **Azure Blob Storage account** that you want to receive events for. 
1. In the **Stream details** section, enter a **name for the eventstream** that the Wizard is going to create, and select the **workspace** where you want to save the eventstream.
1. Then, select **Next** at the bottom of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-azure-blob-storage-events/connect-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Connect settings for an Azure Blob Storage account.":::
1. On the **Review and create** page, review settings, and select **Create source**.

1. When the wizard succeeds in creating a stream, you see a link to **open the eventstream** and **close** the wizard.

## View stream on the Data streams tab

1. In **Real-Time hub**, switch to the **Data streams** tab. 
1. Confirm that you see the stream you created.
