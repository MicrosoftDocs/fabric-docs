# Explore Fabric workspace item events in Fabric Real-Time hub (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](./includes/preview-note.md)]

Fabric workspace item events allow you to receive notification when certain actions occur on your workspace items, such as when a new artifact is created, or an existing artifact is deleted. These events can be used to alert on other actions or workflows in Fabric, such as running a data pipeline or sending an email notification using Data Activator alerting capabilities. This article explains how to explore Fabric workspace item events in Real-Time hub.
