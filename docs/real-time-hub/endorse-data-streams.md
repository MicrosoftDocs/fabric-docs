# Endorse streams in Fabric Real-Time hub

Organizations often have large numbers of Microsoft Fabric items available for sharing and reuse by their Fabric users. It can be difficult to identify trustworthy and authoritative items. Endorsement is a way to make it easier for users to find the high-quality items they need. For more information, see [Endorsement in Fabric](../fundamentals/endorsement-promote-certify.md).

You can endorse a stream from one of the following pages:

- Real-Time hub page
- Stream details page of a stream

## Endorse streams

This section shows how to endorse a stream (whose parent is an eventstream) from the hub page and the stream details page. To learn how to endorse a Kusto Query Language (KQL) table, see [Endorse tables](#endorse-tables).

### Hub page

You can endorse data in a data stream using the following steps:

1. Move the mouse over the stream in the list, select ... (ellipsis)
1. Select **Endorse**.
