1. On the **Connect** page, enter a **name for the source**.
1. Select one of the sample data sources from the drop-down list. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/add-source-sample-data/sample-sources.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the sample data sources available." lightbox="./media/add-source-sample-data/sample-sources.png":::

    1. Select the **workspace** where you want to save the connection.
    1. Enter a **name for the eventstream** to be created for you.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/add-source-sample-data/stream-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the right pane with Stream details section of the Connect page." lightbox="./media/add-source-sample-data/stream-details.png":::                
1. Select **Next**.

## View data stream details

1. On the **Review and create** page, if you select **Open eventstream**, the wizard opens the eventstream that it created for you with the selected sample data source. To close the wizard, select **Close** at the bottom of the page. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/add-source-sample-data/review-create-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Review and create page with links to open eventstream and close the wizard. ":::                
1. In Real-Time hub, switch to the **Data streams** tab of Real-Time hub. Refresh the page. You should see the data stream created for you. For detailed steps, see [View details of data streams in Fabric Real-Time hub](view-data-stream-details.md).
