This article describes how to get events from an Azure Data Explorer database table into Fabric Real-Time hub.

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer-description-prerequisites](../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/includes/azure-data-explorer-description-prerequisites.md)]


## Get events from an Azure Data Explorer table
You can get events from an Azure Data Explorer table into Real-Time hub using the [**Data sources** page](#data-sources-page).

[!INCLUDE [launch-get-events-experience](./includes/launch-get-events-experience.md)]

5. On the **Data sources** page, search for **Azure Data Explorer DB**, and then select **Connect** on the **Azure Data Explorer DB** tile.

## Configure and connect to the Azure Data Explorer table
[!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer-connector](../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/includes/azure-data-explorer-connector.md)]

## View data stream details
1. On the **Review + connect** page, if you select **Open eventstream**, the wizard opens the eventstream that it created for you with the selected Azure Data Explorer table as a source. To close the wizard, select **Finish** at the bottom of the page.

2. You should see the stream on the **All data streams** and **My data streams** pages. For detailed steps, see [View details of data streams in Fabric Real-Time hub](view-data-stream-details.md).
