# Get started with Fabric Real-Time hub (preview)
Real-Time hub is the single estate for all data-in-motion across your entire organization. Every Microsoft Fabric tenant is automatically provisioned with Real-Time hub, with no extra steps needed to set up or manages it. For detailed overview, see [Real-Time hub overview](real-time-hub-overview.md).

This article provides guidance on getting started with Fabric Real-Time hub. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](./includes/preview-note.md)]

## Navigate to Real-Time hub

[!INCLUDE [navigate-to-real-time-hub](./includes/navigate-to-real-time-hub.md)]

## Data streams tab
On the **Data streams** tab, you see streams and tables. Streams are the outputs from [Fabric eventstreams](../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview.md) and tables are from Kusto Query Language (KQL) databases that you have access to. 

1. To **explore** streams and tables that you have access, use instructions from [Explore data streams](explore-data-streams.md). 
1. To **view details** for a stream or a table, see [View data stream details](view-data-stream-details.md).
1. To **preview data** in a data stream, see [Preview data streams](preview-data-streams.md).
1. To **endorse** data streams for others to use, see [Endorse streams](endorse-data-streams.md)
1. You can also open an eventstream that's the parent of a data stream (or) open KQL database that's the parent of a KQL table.

## Microsoft sources tab
On the **Microsoft sources** tab, you see the following types of Microsoft sources that you have access to. 

[!INCLUDE [microsoft-sources](./includes/microsoft-sources.md)]

You can connect to these resources and create eventstreams that show up on the **Data streams** tab. Select a link for a source in the list to learn how to create an event stream for that source.

## Fabric events tab
On the **Fabric events** tab, you see the following types of events. 
[!INCLUDE [discrete-event-sources](./includes/discrete-event-sources.md)]

To **explore Fabric events**, see [Explore Fabric events in Real-Time hub](explore-fabric-events.md).

You can **create eventstreams** for events from your Azure Blob Storage accounts or Fabric Workspaces. You can also set up an alert to send notifications via email, Teams etc. when an event occurs. Use links from the list to navigate to articles that show you how to create eventstreams for Azure Blob Storage events and Fabric workspace item events. 

See following articles to learn how to **setup alerts** on Fabric events: 

- [Set alerts on Azure Blob Storage events](set-alerts-azure-blob-storage-events.md)
- [Set alerts on Fabric workspace item events](set-alerts-fabric-workspace-item-events.md)

## Get events 
You can connect to data from both inside and outside of Fabric in a mere few steps using the **Get events experience** within Fabric, including Real-Time hub. Whether data is coming from new or existing sources, streams, or available events, the Get events experience allows you to connect to a wide range of event sources directly from Real-Time hub. 

It allows for easy connectivity to external data streams including Kafka connectors powered by Kafka Connect and Debezium connectors for fetching the Change Data Capture (CDC) streams. Connectivity to notification sources and discrete events is also included within Get events, this enables access to notification events from Azure and other clouds solutions including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.  

Select **Get events** from the Real-Time hub and follow the prompts to complete the flow. Here's a full list of built-in sources inside Get events

[!INCLUDE [supported-sources](./includes/supported-sources.md)]

You can connect to these services and create eventstreams that show up on the **Data streams** tab. Select a link for a source in the list to learn how to create an event stream for that source.
