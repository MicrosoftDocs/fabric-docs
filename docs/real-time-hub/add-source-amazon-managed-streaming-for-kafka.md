# Add Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) as source in Real-Time hub
This article describes how to add Amazon Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) as an event source in Fabric Real-Time hub. 

Amazon MSK Kafka is a fully managed Kafka service that simplifies the setup, scaling, and management. By integrating Amazon MSK Kafka as a source within your eventstream, you can seamlessly bring the real-time events from your MSK Kafka and process it before routing them to multiple destinations within Fabric.â€¯ 




## Prerequisites 

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions.  
- An Amazon MSK Kafka cluster in active status. 
- Your Amazon MSK Kafka cluster must be publicly accessible and not be behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.
