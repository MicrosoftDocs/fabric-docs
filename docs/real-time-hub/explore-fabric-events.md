## Actions

Here are the actions available on each event type group. When you move the mouse over an event group, you see three buttons to create an eventstream, create an alert, and an ellipsis (...). When you select ellipsis (...), you see the same actions: **Create eventstream** and **Set alert**.

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Create eventstream | This action creates an eventstream on the selected event type group with all Event types selected. For more information, see [Get Fabric workspace item events](create-streams-fabric-workspace-item-events.md). |
| Set alert | This action sets an alert on the selected event type group. For more information, see [Set alerts on Fabric workspace item events](set-alerts-fabric-workspace-item-events.md). |
