# Preview streams in Fabric Real-Time hub

## From the hub page
On the Real-Time hub page, in the **Recent streaming data** section, use one of the following options:

- Move the mouse over the stream and select the eye button.
- Move the mouse over the stream in the list, select ... (ellipsis), and then select **Preview data**.
