# Preview streams in Fabric Real-Time hub
Data preview provides you with a snapshot of your event data in your stream. You can visualize how the data flows through the data stream. There are two places from where you can preview data in stream.


## From Data streams page

You can preview data in a stream whose parent is an eventstream using one of the following options on the **Data streams** page of the **Real-Time hub**. 

- Move the mouse over the stream and select the eye button. 
- Move the mouse over the stream in the list, select ... (ellipsis), and then select **Preview data**.
