# Get events from Azure Event Grid namespace into Fabric Real-Time hub
This article describes how to get events from an Azure Event Grid namespace into Fabric Real-Time hub.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- Enable [managed identity](/azure/event-grid/event-grid-namespace-managed-identity) on the Event Grid namespace. 
- If you want to receive Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) data, enable [MQTT](/azure/event-grid/mqtt-publish-and-subscribe-portal) and [routing](/azure/event-grid/mqtt-routing) on the Event Grid namespace. 


## Get events from an Azure Event Grid namespace
You can get events from an Azure Event Grid namespace into Real-Time hub using the [**Data sources** page](#data-sources-page).

[!INCLUDE [launch-get-events-experience](./includes/launch-get-events-experience.md)]

5. On the **Data sources** page, search for **Azure Event Grid namespace**, and then select **Connect** on the **Azure Event Grid Namespace** tile.

## Configure and connect to the Event Grid namespace
[!INCLUDE [azure-event-grid-source-connector](../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/includes/azure-event-grid-source-connector.md)]

## View data stream details
1. On the **Review + connect** page, if you select **Open eventstream**, the wizard opens the eventstream that it created for you with the selected Event Grid namespace as a source. To close the wizard, select **Finish** at the bottom of the page.

2. You should see the stream on the **All data streams** and **My data streams** pages. For detailed steps, see [View details of data streams in Fabric Real-Time hub](view-data-stream-details.md).
