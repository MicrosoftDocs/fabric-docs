# Explore Job events in Fabric Real-Time hub

Real-Time hub allows you to discover and subscribe to changes produced when Fabric runs a job. For example, you can react to changes when refreshing a semantic model, running a scheduled pipeline, or running a notebook. Each of these activities can generate a corresponding job, which in turn generates a set of corresponding job events. 

Job events allow you to monitor job results in time and set up alerts using Activator alerting capabilities. For example, when the scheduler triggers a new job, or a job fails, you can receive an email alert. This way, even if you aren't in front of the computer, you can still get the information you care about.
