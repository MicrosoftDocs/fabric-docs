# SKU considerations

To use Microsoft Fabric you need to have a [capacity license](licenses.md#capacity-license). Each capacity license is associated with a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU). Each SKU has its own considerations and limitations. This article links to SKU considerations and limitations for different Fabric experiences.

## Considerations based on experience
