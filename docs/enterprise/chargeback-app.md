# Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

The Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app helps you understand which teams, users, and workloads are driving capacity usage, enabling you to build chargeback processes that fairly allocate costs based on actual consumption. As a capacity admin, you can view key parameters such as metric types, dates, and operation names, and share the report with others in your organization to support transparent and informed cost management.

## Install the Fabric Chargeback app

To install the app, follow the instructions in [Install the Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app](chargeback-app-install.md).

## Visuals

> [!NOTE]
> If a workspace or item is not associated with any domain or subdomain, its usage will be categorized under the "No domain" or "No subdomain".

Understand what the visuals in the report show.

- **Workspace, item, and domain/subdomain** - Shows what percent of your capacity was utilized by workspaces, items, or domains/subdomain. Select the **Workspace**, **Item**, or **Domain** tab to view your capacity's utilization percent by workspace, item, or domain/subdomain respectively.
- **Utilization (CU) by date** - Shows your daily utilization.
- **Utilization (CU) details** - A matrix table that shows utilization and user details. Hover over users column to see breakdown of Utilization (CU) by user.

## Drill through

By right-clicking on a workspace or an item in the *Workspace and item* visual, you can drill through to see more details. For example, you can drill through to see the utilization of a specific workspace. There are three pages you can drill through to:

- **Workspace details** - Shows the utilization of a specific workspace.
- **Item details** - Shows the utilization of a specific item.
- **Domain details** - Shows the utilization of a specific domain or subdomain.

## Data export

Export the report's data by selecting **Export data**, which takes you to a page with a matrix visual that displays utilization and user details for all the available capacities. Use slicers to filter out the data. Hover over the matrix and select **More options** to export the data.

Select different columns from the slicer named _Select columns to add in hierarchy_ to export data for those columns.

> [!NOTE]
> You might encounter this error during export: "This visual has exceeded the available resources. Try filtering to decrease the amount of data displayed."
>
> To resolve this error, either apply filters to reduce the data volume or avoid expanding multiple capacities to the lower granularity level (such as item name) during export

## Considerations and limitations

When using the Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app, be aware of the following considerations and limitations:

- The Fabric Chargeback Report data isn't real-time; it's refreshed daily. Users can manually trigger a refresh by navigating to the workspace where the app is installed.
- If an operation isn't associated with a user, or if the operation is initiated by a service principal, the report displays the username as "Power BI Service".
- When the [Show user data in the Fabric Capacity Metrics app and reports](../admin/service-admin-portal-audit-usage.md#show-user-data-in-the-fabric-capacity-metrics-app-and-reports) setting is disabled, the username is shown as "Masked user" for nonservice operations, and the user count considers all masked users as a single user.
- Visuals on the **Export** page may fail to render properly when too many drill-downs are applied due to memory limitations in Power BI. To avoid this, either apply filters to reduce the data volume or avoid expanding multiple capacities to the lower granularity level (such as item name) during export.
- The semantic model used by the Microsoft Fabric Chargeback application is only supported for use by the reports provided in the application. Any consumption from, usage of, or modification of the semantic model is not supported.
