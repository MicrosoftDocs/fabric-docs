# Install the Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

The Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app, also known as the chargeback app. It provides turnkey insights that help organizations implement effective chargeback policies - enabling a fair distribution of costs based on actual usage patterns across your Fabric environment. Use this guide to install the app.
