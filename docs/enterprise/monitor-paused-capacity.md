# Monitor a paused capacity

To monitor [paused capacities](pause-resume.md), use the latest version of the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](metrics-app.md).

## View the paused capacity events

The [system events](metrics-app-compute-page.md#system-events) table lists all the paused capacity events. Use this table to see when your capacity was paused and when it was reactivated. In the *State* column, a paused capacity is listed as *Suspended*, and a resumed capacity is listed as *Active*. Use the *Time* column to calculate the amount of time your capacity was active or paused.

## Why is there a spike in the utilization chart when I pause my capacity?

To provide optimal performance, your capacity [smooths](throttling.md) usage over future timepoints. When you pause your capacity, the accumulated smoothed usage and any overages are converted to utilization and billed to you. As a result, a spike appears in the [Utilization](metrics-app-compute-page.md#utilization) visual.

When you hover over the spike, a tooltip shows the state of the capacity.

## View carryforward operations

You can find the percentage of [carryforward](throttling.md) operations that your capacity had when it was paused.

1. Locate the paused capacity timepoint by reviewing the spike in the utilization visual.

2. Right-click the paused capacity's timepoint and drill through to the [Timepoint Detail](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md) page.

3. Hover over the SKU card. A tooltip displays the remaining cumulative carryforward percent.

## Considerations and limitations

* When you pause a capacity, the timepoint of the paused capacity is displayed on the [Timepoint page](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md) 30 seconds afterward. This timepoint includes all of your capacityâ€™s reconciled consumption. If you have enabled [capacity alerts](../admin/service-admin-premium-capacity-notifications.md) you might receive a false alert that your capacity usage has exceeded the threshold you specified, after it was paused.

* When you pause a capacity, the timepoint preceding the timepoint at which the capacity was paused is canceled and doesn't appear on the [Compute page](metrics-app-compute-page.md). For example, if you pause your capacity at 13:00:00, the 12:29:30 timepoint won't exist.
* When you pause a capacity, after the _Suspended_ event is shown, you may see an _Active NotOverloaded_ event. The capacity is still paused. This occurs if your capacity was overloaded prior to the capacity being paused.
