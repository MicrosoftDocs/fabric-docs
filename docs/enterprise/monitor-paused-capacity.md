# Monitor a paused capacity

To monitor [paused capacities](pause-resume.md), use the latest version of the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](metrics-app.md).

## View the paused capacity events

The [system events](metrics-app-compute-page.md#system-events) table lists all the paused capacity events. Use this table to see when your capacity was paused and when it was reactivated. In the *State* column, a paused capacity is listed as *Suspended*, and a resumed capacity is listed as *Active*. Use the *Time* column to calculate the amount of time your capacity was active or paused.

## Why is my capacity spiking?

To allow your capacity to perform at the highest level, its usage is [smoothed](throttling.md#balance-between-performance-and-reliability) over time. When you pause your capacity, the remaining cumulative overages and smoothed operations are executed. As a result, a spike appears in the [Utilization](metrics-app-compute-page.md#utilization) visual.

The spike provides an indication that your capacity was paused. You can hover over the spike to view and see the state of the capacity in the tooltip.

## View carryforward operations

You can find out what's the percentage of [carryforward](throttling.md#carryforward-capacity-usage-reduction) operations that your capacity had when it was paused.

1. Locate the paused capacity timepoint by reviewing the spike in the utilization visual.

2. Right-click the paused capacity's timepoint, and drill through to the [Timepoint Detail](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md) page.

3. Hover over the SKU card. A tooltip displays the remaining cumulative carryforward percent.

## Considerations and limitations

* After you pause a capacity, the timepoint of the paused capacity in the [timepoint page](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md), is displayed 30 seconds after the capacity was paused. This timepoint includes all of your capacityâ€™s reconciled consumption.

* When pausing a capacity, the timepoint prior to the timepoint the capacity was paused at, is cancelled and doesn't appear in the [compute page](metrics-app-compute-page.md). For example, if you paused your capacity at 13:00:00, the 12:29:30 timepoint will not exist.
