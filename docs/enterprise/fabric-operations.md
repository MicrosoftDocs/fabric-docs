# Fabric operations

Each experience within Microsoft Fabric supports unique operations. An operation's consumption rate is what converts the usage of the experience's raw metrics into Compute Units (CU).

The Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app's [compute page](metrics-app-compute-page.md) provides an overview of your capacity's performance and lists Fabric operations that consume compute resources.  

This article lists these operations by experience, and explains how they consume resources within Fabric.

## Interactive and background operations

Microsoft Fabric divides operations into two types, *interactive* and *background*. This article lists these operations and explains the difference between them.

### Interactive operations

On-demand requests and operations that can be triggered by user interactions with the UI, such as data model queries generated by report visuals, are classified as *interactive* operations. They're usually triggered by user interactions with the UI. For example, an interactive operation is triggered when a user opens a report or selects a slicer in a Power BI report. Interactive operations can also be triggered without interacting with the UI, for example when using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a custom application to run a DAX query.

### Background operations

Longer running operations such as semantic model or dataflow refreshes are classified as *background* operations. They can be triggered manually by a user, or automatically without user interaction. Background operations include scheduled refreshes, interactive refreshes, REST-based refreshes and XMLA-based refresh operations. Users aren't expected to wait for these operations to finish. Instead, they might come back later to check the status of the operations.

## How to read this document

Each experience has a table that lists its operations, with the following columns:

* **Operation** – The name of the operation. Visible in the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](metrics-app.md).

* **Description** – A description of the operation.

* **Item** – The item that this operation can apply to. Visible in the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](metrics-app.md).

* **Azure billing meter** – The name of the meter on your Azure bill that shows usage for this operation.

* **Type** – Lists the type of the operation. Operations are classified as [interactive](#interactive-operations) or [background](#background-operations) operations.

When more details regarding the consumption rate are available, a link to the document with this information is provided.

## Fabric operations by experience

This section is divided into Fabric experience. Each experience had a table that lists its operations.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Consumption rates are subject to change at any time. Microsoft will use reasonable efforts to provide notice via email or through in-product notification. Changes shall be effective on the date stated in Microsoft's [Release Notes](https://aka.ms/fabricrm) or [Microsoft Fabric blog](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/). If any change to a Microsoft Fabric Workload Consumption Rate materially increases the Capacity Units (CU) required to use a particular workload, customers might use the cancellation options available for the chosen payment method.

### Fabric User Data Functions

[Fabric User Data Functions](https://aka.ms/ms-fabric-functions-docs) operations are made up of requests initiated by the Fabric portal, other Fabric artifacts, or client applications. Each request and response operation incurs a charge for the function execution, internal storage of the function metadata in OneLake, and associated read and write operations in OneLake.

| Operation          | Description                                                                                        | Item      | Azure billing meter | Type       |
