# Understand the metrics app timepoint page

All the operations in your capacity are ranked according to their compute impact. The compute impact of all your capacity operations is what we call capacity usage, and it's measured using capacity units (CUs). Use this page to understand which [*interactive* and *background*](fabric-operations.md#interactive-and-background-operations) operations contributed the most to your capacity's usage.

Scheduled and manual refresh workflows can trigger multiple internal operations in the backend service. For example, refreshes sometimes perform automatic retries if a temporary error occurred. These operations might be recorded in the app using different activity IDs. Each activity ID is represented as a row in the table. When reviewing the table, take into consideration that several rows may indicate a single action that triggers multiple operations, each with its own activity ID.

When the total combined CUs for *interactive* and *background* operations exceed the 30 second timepoint allowance, the capacity is overloaded and depending on whether autoscale is enabled or not, throttling is applied.

* **Autoscale is enabled** - If the capacity has autoscale enabled, a new CU will get added for the next 24 hours and will be shown as an increased value in the *CU Limit* line in the [Capacity utilization and throttling](metrics-app-compute-page.md#capacity-utilization-and-throttling) chart and the *CU (s)* card will change its color to yellow.

    When autoscale is enabled, if the capacity reaches the maximum number of CUs allowed by the autoscale operation, throttling is applied.

* **Autoscale isn't enabled** - If autoscale isn't enabled, throttling gets applied to every interactive operation in the subsequent timepoint.

## Top row visuals

This section describes the operations of the visuals in the top row of the timepoint page.

* **Start/end card** - Displays the start and end date and time (timepoint) used to get to this page.

* **Heartbeat line chart** - Shows a 60 minute window of CU activity. Use this visual to establish the duration of peaks and troughs.

    * *Vertical light green line* - The timepoint you currently viewed. The visual shows the 30 minutes of CU activity leading to the selected timepoint, as well as the 30 minutes of CU activity after the selected timepoint.

    * *CU % Limit* - The capacity allowance.

    * *CU %* - The capacity usage.

    There are also three colors describing the capacity usage:

    * *Green* - The percent of CU consumption.

    * *Red* - The percent of CU consumption limit.

    * *Yellow* - The percent of CU consumption that's autoscaled.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If the yellow line is above the red line the capacity is overloaded.

* **Interactive operations card** - Displays the total number of interactive operations that contributed to the CU's activity during this timepoint.

* **Background operations card** - Displays the total number of background operations that contributed to the CU's activity during this timepoint.

* **SKU card** - Displays the current SKU.

* **Capacity CU card** - Displays the total number of CU seconds allowed for this capacity, for a given 30 second timepoint window. User can hover over card to see bifurcation of Base CU (s) and Autoscale CU (s). When autoscale is enabled, the card will change its color to yellow.

## Interactive operations for timerange

A table showing every [interactive operations](fabric-operations.md#interactive-operations) that contributed capacity units (CUs) usage in the viewed timepoint. It fetches the top 100k records based on capacity units. Once an interactive operation completes, all of the CU seconds used by it get attributed to the timepoint window.

Start and end times may occur before or after the displayed time period, due to [background](fabric-operations.md#background-operations) [smoothing](throttling.md) operations.

* **Workspace** - The workspace the item belongs to.

* **Item kind** - The type of the item.

* **Item name** - The name of the item.

* **Operation** - The type of interactive operation.

* **Start** - The time the interactive operation began.

* **End** - The time the interactive operation finished.

* **Status** - An indication showing if the operation succeeded, failed, or is in progress. Canceled operations are reported as failed operations.

    >[!NOTE]
    >CU usage for failed operations is counted when determining if the capacity is in overload.

* **User** - The name of the user that triggered the interactive operation.

* **Duration (s)** - The number of seconds the interactive operation took to complete.

* **Total CU (s)** - The number of CU seconds used by the interactive operation. This metric contributes to determine if the capacity exceeds the total number of CU seconds allowed for the capacity.

* **Timepoint CU (s)** - The number of CU seconds assigned to the interactive operation in the current timepoint.

* **Throttling (s)** - The number of seconds of throttling applied to this interactive operation because of the capacity being overloaded in the previous timepoint.

* **% Of Base Capacity** - Interactive CU operations as a proportion of the base capacity allowance.

* **Billing type** - Displays information if the item is billable or not.

    * **Billable** - Indicates that operations for this item are billable.

    * **Non-Billable**  - Indicates that operations for this item are non-billable.

* **Operation ID** - A unique identifier assigned to an individual operation.

* **Smoothing start** - The time smoothing started for the operation.

* **Smoothing end** - The time smoothing ended for the operation.

* **Virtualized item** - Displays one of the following values:
    * *True* - Virtual items that consume CUs, for example virtual items used by Copilot.
    * *False* - Items that aren't virtual.

* **Virtualized workspace** - Displays one of the following values:
    * *True* - Virtual workspaces that consume CUs, for example a virtual workspace used by a virtual network.
    * *False* - Workspaces that aren't virtual.

## Background operations for timerange

A table showing every background operation that contributed Capacity Unit(CU) usage to the viewed timepoint. It fetches the top 100k records based on capacity units. Every background operation that completed within the last 24 hours (defined as a window of 2,880 intervals, each lasting 30 seconds) contributes a small portion of its total usage to the CU value. This means that a background operation that completed the previous day can contribute some CU activity to determine if the capacity is in overload. For more information see [the Fabric throttling policy](throttling.md).

All the columns in the background operations table are similar to the ones in the [interactive operations](#interactive-operations-for-timerange) table.

## Burndown table for timerange

A table showing the *add*, *burndown* and *cumulative* percent by experiences, for the last 30 seconds.

* **Experience** - The name of the experience.

* **Add %** - The percentage of carryforward added compared to the capacity, for a 30 seconds window.

* **Burndown %** - The percentage of carryforward burndown compared to the capacity, for a 30 seconds window.

* **Cumulative %** - The percentage of cumulative carryforward compared to the capacity, for a 30 seconds window.

* **Minutes to burndown** - The estimated time, in minutes, it'll take the cumulative CUs to burndown, assuming no further consumption or smoothing takes place.

## Overages

You can change the overages visual scale to display 10 minutes, 60 minutes and 24 hours. Carryforward only takes into account billable operations.

* **Add %** - The green columns represent the percentage of carryforward added within the specified timepoint window.
  
* **Burndown %** - The blue columns represent the percentage of carryforward burned down within the specified timepoint window.
  
* **Cumulative %** - The red line represents the cumulative carryforward within the specified timepoint window. Cumulative percent is displayed on the secondary axis located on the right side of the visual.
