# Install the Microsoft Fabric capacity metrics app

The *Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics* app, also known as the *metrics app*, is designed to provide monitoring capabilities for Fabric and Power BI Premium capacities. Use this guide to install the app.

## Prerequisites

To install the metrics app, you need to be a capacity admin.

## Install the app

Follow the steps according to the type of installation you need. If you're installing the app in a government cloud environment, use the links in [government clouds](#government-clouds).

To avoid throttling due to capacity overutilization, install the app in a workspace with a [Pro license](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-features-license-type#pro-license).

    * **Update only workspace content without updating the app**

    Updates the workspace but doesn't update the app. Select this option to update the app's workspace without upgrading the app.

    * **Install another copy of the app into a new workspace**
