## Prerequisites

To install the metrics app, you need to be a capacity admin.

## Install the app

Follow the steps according to the type of installation you need. If you're installing the app in a government cloud environment, use the links in [government clouds](#government-clouds).

To avoid throttling due to capacity overutilization, install the app in a workspace with a [Pro license](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-features-license-type#pro-license).
