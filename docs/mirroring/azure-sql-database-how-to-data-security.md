# How to: Secure data Microsoft Fabric mirrored databases from Azure SQL Database

This guide helps you establish data security in your mirrored Azure SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric.

## Security requirements

1. If your Azure SQL Database is not publicly accessible and doesn't [allow Azure services](/azure/azure-sql/database/network-access-controls-overview#allow-azure-services) to connect to it, you can [create a virtual network data gateway](/data-integration/vnet/create-data-gateways) or [install an on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install) to mirror the data. Make sure the Azure Virtual Network or the gateway machine's network can connect to the Azure SQL server via [a private endpoint](/azure/azure-sql/database/private-endpoint-overview?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true) or is allowed by the firewall rule.
1. The System Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI) of your Azure SQL logical server needs to be enabled, and must be the primary identity. To configure, go to your logical SQL Server in the Azure portal. Under **Security** the resource menu, select **Identity**. Under **System assigned managed identity**, select **Status** to **On**.
   - After enabling the SAMI, if the SAMI is disabled or removed, the mirroring of Azure SQL Database to Fabric OneLake will fail.
   - After enabling the SAMI, if you add a user assigned managed identity (UAMI), it will become the primary identity, replacing the SAMI as primary. This causes replication to fail. To resolve, remove the UAMI.
1. Fabric needs to connect to the Azure SQL database. For this purpose, create a dedicated database user with limited permissions, to follow the principle of least privilege. Create either a login with a strong password and connected user, or a contained database user with a strong password. For a tutorial, see [Tutorial: Configure Microsoft Fabric mirrored databases from Azure SQL Database](../mirroring/azure-sql-database-tutorial.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any granular security established in the source database must be reconfigured in the mirrored database in Microsoft Fabric.
> For more information, see [SQL granular permissions in Microsoft Fabric](../data-warehouse/sql-granular-permissions.md).

## Data protection features

You can secure column filters and predicate-based row filters on tables to roles and users in Microsoft Fabric:

- [Row-level security in Fabric data warehousing](../data-warehouse/row-level-security.md)
- [Column-level security in Fabric data warehousing](../data-warehouse/column-level-security.md)

You can also mask sensitive data from non-admins using dynamic data masking:
