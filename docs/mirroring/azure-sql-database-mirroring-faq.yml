summary: |
  This article answers frequently asked questions about Mirroring Azure SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric.

sections:
  - name: Features and capabilities
    questions:
      - question: |
          What authentication to the Azure SQL Database is allowed? 
        answer: 
          Currently, for authentication to the source Azure SQL Database, we support SQL authentication with user name and password, Microsoft Entra ID, and Service Principal. 

      - question: |
           Is there a staging or landing zone for Azure SQL Database? If so, is it outside of OneLake? 
        answer: 
          A landing zone in OneLake stores both the snapshot and change data, to improve performance when converting files into delta verti-parquet.

      - question: |
          How long does the initial replication take? 
        answer: 
          It depends on the size of the data that is being brought in. 

      - question: |
          How long does it take to replicate inserts/updates/deletes? 
        answer: 
          Near real-time latency.
      - question: |
          Do you support replicating of views, transient or external tables? 
        answer: 
          No. Currently, only replicating regular tables are supported.

      - question: |
          How do I manage connections? 
        answer: 
          Select the settings cog, then select **Manage connection and gateways**. You can also delete existing connections from this page.

      - question: |
          Can Power BI reports on mirrored data use direct lake mode?
        answer: 
          Yes, since tables are all v-ordered delta tables.

    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I know Fabric is replicating data on my Azure SQL Database? 
        answer: |
           If you're experiencing mirroring problems, perform the following database level checks using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and stored procedures to validate configuration. [Contact support](/power-bi/support/service-support-options) if troubleshooting is required.
           - Execute the following query to check if the changes properly flow: 
              ```sql
              SELECT * FROM sys.dm_change_feed_log_scan_sessions 
              ```

           For troubleshooting steps, see [Troubleshoot Fabric mirrored databases from Azure SQL Database](azure-sql-database-troubleshoot.md).
      - question: |
          How to enable System assigned managed identity (SAMI) on SQL Server? 
        answer: |
          With a single step in the Azure portal, you can [enable System Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI) of your Azure SQL logical server](azure-sql-database-tutorial.md#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-sami-of-your-azure-sql-logical-server).

      - question: |
          What are the replication statuses? 
        answer: 
          See [Monitor Fabric mirrored database replication](monitor.md).

      - question: |
          Can Azure SQL Database mirroring be accessed through the Power BI Gateway or behind a firewall? 
        answer: 
          If your Azure SQL Database is not publicly accessible and doesn't allow Azure services to connect to it, you can [set up virtual network data gateway or on-premises data gateway to mirror the data](azure-sql-database.md#mirroring-azure-sql-database-behind-firewall). For more information, see [Security requirements](azure-sql-database-how-to-data-security.md).

      - question: |
          What steps does restarting the Mirroring include? 
        answer: 
           The data from source tables will be reinitialized. Each time you stop and start, the entire table is fetched again.

      - question: |
           What happens if I remove a table from Mirroring?
        answer: 
           The table is no longer replicated and its data is deleted from OneLake.

      - question: |
          If I delete the Mirror, does it affect the source Azure SQL Database? 
        answer: 
          No, we just remove the streaming tables.

      - question: |
          Can I mirror the same source database multiple times? 
        answer: 
          No, each Azure SQL Database can only be mirrored once. You just need a single copy of the data in Fabric OneLake, which you can share with others.

      - question: |
          Can I mirror only specific tables from my Azure SQL Database? 
        answer: 
          Yes, specific tables can be selected during Mirroring configuration.

      - question: |
          What happens to Mirroring in an event of planned or unplanned Geo failover? 
        answer: |
          When you create the mirrored database, connect to the read-write listener of the SQL failover group. This way you would not need to recreate the mirrored database after the failover.

          Once the mirrored database is created, go to the workspace item list, and select **Manage Permissions** for the mirrored database. Add the System Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI) for both the primary and secondary logical server of the failover group to have read/write access. If you create the mirrored database from the Fabric portal, the SAMI of the primary server should already be added automatically.

          When failover happens, replication is disabled automatically. However, if you open the mirrored database in the Fabric portal, you won't see any difference, but new data won't arrive. To recover, select **Stop Replication**, then **Start Replication**, to restart the replication process. This will resync every table from scratch. The same is required after failing back.
          
  - name: Security
    questions:
      - question: |
          Is data ever leaving the customers Fabric tenant? 
        answer: 
          No. 
      - question: |
          Is data staged outside of a customer environment? 
        answer: 
          No. Data isn't staged outside of customer environment, it's staged in the customer's OneLake.

  - name: Cost Management 
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the costs associated with Mirroring?
        answer: 
          Fabric compute used to replicate your data into Fabric OneLake is free. The Mirroring storage cost is free up to a limit based on capacity. For more information, see [Cost of mirroring](overview.md#cost-of-mirroring) and [Microsoft Fabric Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/). The compute for querying data using SQL, Power BI, or Spark is charged at regular rates. 
      - question: |
          What do we recommend a customer do to avoid or reduce Azure SQL Database costs? 
        answer: 
          See [Plan and manage costs for Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/cost-management). Consider using a dedicated, smaller Azure SQL Database, based on requirements.
      - question: |
          How are ingress fees handled? 
        answer: 
          Fabric doesn't charge for Ingress fees into OneLake for Mirroring.
      - question: |
          How are egress fees handled?
        answer: 
          If the Azure SQL Database is located in a different region from your Fabric capacity, data egress will be charged. If in the same region, there is no data egress.

  - name: Licensing
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are licensing options for Fabric Mirroring? 
        answer:
          A Power BI Premium, Fabric Capacity, or Trial Capacity is required. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Fabric concepts and licenses](../../enterprise/licenses.md).

  - name: Stop or pause Fabric Mirroring
    questions:

      - question: |
          What are the results of stopping Mirroring?
        answer: 
          Replication stops in the source database, but a copy of the tables is kept in OneLake. Restarting the mirroring results in all data being replicated from the start.

      - question: |
          How to stop/disable Mirroring from your Azure SQL Database?  
        answer: |
          If you're unable to Stop mirroring your Azure SQL Database from the Fabric portal, or unable to delete your mirrored Azure SQL Database item from Fabric, execute the following stored procedure on your Azure SQL Database: `exec sp_change_feed_disable_db;`

      - question: | 
          What if I stop or pause my Fabric capacity?
        answer: |
          The Fabric capacity needs to be active and running. A paused or deleted capacity will affect Mirroring and no data will be replicated.
