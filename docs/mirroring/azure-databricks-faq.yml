        1. Select the **Settings** button in your workspace.

        1. Select **Cloud Object**.
        1. Provide a **Connection name**.
        1. For **Connection type**, search for or type "Azure Databricks workspace".
        1. Paste your Databricks workspace URL into the **URL** field.
        1. Select **Edit credentials** and select your auth ID.
        1. Select **Create**.
        1. You can now go back to the Workspace landing page select **New Item+** from the workspace then select **Mirrored Azure Databricks catalog**.

    - question: |
        What if I cannot perform an action because there is already existing sync in progress?
      answer:
         In the event the catalog is performing a metadata sync and **Manage catalog** is selected, you could be blocked from modifying the catalog until the sync is complete. Wait for the sync to complete and try **Manage catalog** again.
