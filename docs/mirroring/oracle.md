# Mirroring Oracle Databases (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

[Mirroring in Fabric](overview.md) lets you mirror your Oracle databases into a unified analytics platform. When you mirror your Oracle data, you can analyze it together with data from other sources in near real-time with minimal latency and cost.

## Oracle environments we support

We support these Oracle Server environments:

* Oracle versions 11 and above with LogMiner enabled
* Oracle on-premises (VM, Azure VM)
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
* Oracle Exadata

>[!NOTE]
>* LogMiner needs to be enabled on your Oracle server. This tool helps track changes in your Oracle database for real-time mirroring.
>* Oracle Autonomous Database isn't supported in this preview.

## Built-in analytics features

When you mirror an Oracle database, Fabric creates:

* A mirrored database in [OneLake](../onelake/onelake-overview.md) that handles data replication
* A [SQL analytics endpoint](../data-warehouse/get-started-lakehouse-sql-analytics-endpoint.md) for data analysis

The SQL analytics endpoint lets you:

* Browse your tables
* Build queries without code
* Create SQL views, inline table functions, and stored procedures
* Control access to your data
* Connect to data in other Warehouses and Lakehouses in your workspace

You can work with your data using tools you know:

* [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
* [VS Code with the MSSQL extension](/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/mssql-extensions)
* Fabric's SQL query editor

## Prerequisites

Before you set up Oracle mirroring, you need:

* A [supported Oracle server](#oracle-environments-we-support)
* LogMiner enabled
* [Archive log mode](oracle-tutorial.md#set-up-archive-of-redo-log-files) enabled
* [Supplemental logging](oracle-tutorial.md#set-up-oracle-permissions-and-enable-supplemental-logging) configured
* [On-Premises Data Gateway](oracle-tutorial.md#install-the-on-premises-data-gateway) installed and set up
* [Required user permissions](oracle-limitations.md#required-permissions)

For complete setup instructions and requirements, see:

* [Oracle mirroring setup guide](oracle-tutorial.md)
* [Oracle mirroring limitations](oracle-limitations.md)

## Database tiers and pricing

Your source database can be a single database or part of an elastic pool.

We support these database models:

* All [vCore model](/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tiers-sql-database-vcore) service tiers
* [DTU model](/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tiers-dtu) databases with 100 DTUs or more

Currently, we don't support DTU databases in the Free, Basic, or Standard tiers that have fewer than 100 DTUs.

## Cost overview

There's no charge for these components:

* The compute used to replicate your data to OneLake
* OneLake storage based on capacity size

You only pay for the compute you use when querying data through SQL, Power BI, or Spark, based on your Fabric Capacity.
