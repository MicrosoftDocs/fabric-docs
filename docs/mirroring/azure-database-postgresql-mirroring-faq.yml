  - name: Features and capabilities
    questions:
      - question: |
          What authentication to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server is allowed? 
        answer: 
          Currently, for authentication to the source Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, we support basic authentication with user name and password. Microsoft Entra ID users, and Service Principal will be supported soon. 

      - question: |
           Is there a staging or landing zone for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server? If so, is it outside of OneLake? 
        answer: 
          A landing zone in OneLake stores both the snapshot and change data, to improve performance when converting files into delta tables.

      - question: |
          How long does the initial replication take? 
        answer: 
          It depends on the size of the data that is being brought in. 

      - question: |
          How long does it take to replicate inserts/updates/deletes? 
        answer: 
          Near real-time latency.
      - question: |
          Do you support replicating of views, partitioned or external tables? 
        answer: 
          No. Currently, only replicating regular tables are supported.

      - question: |
          How do I manage connections? 
        answer: 
          Select the settings cog, then select on **Manage connection and gateways**. You can also delete existing connections from this page.

      - question: |
          Can Power BI reports on mirrored data use direct lake mode?
        answer: 
          Yes, since tables are all v-ordered delta tables.

    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I know Fabric is replicating data on my Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server? 
        answer: |
           If you're experiencing mirroring problems, perform the following server level checks using system catalog views and functions to validate configuration. [Contact support](/power-bi/support/service-support-options) if troubleshooting is required.
           - Execute the following query to check if the changes properly flow: 
              ```sql
              select * from azure_cdc.tracked_publications; 
              ```

           For troubleshooting steps, see [Troubleshoot Fabric mirrored databases from Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server](azure-database-postgresql-troubleshoot.md).
      - question: |
          How to enable System assigned managed identity (SAMI) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server? 
        answer: |
          With a single step in the Azure portal, you can [enable System Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI) of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server](azure-database-postgresql-tutorial.md#prepare-your-azure-database-for-postgresql).

      - question: |
          What are the replication statuses? 
        answer: 
          See [Monitor Fabric Mirror replication](monitor.md).

      - question: |
          Can Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server mirroring be accessed through the Power BI Gateway or behind a firewall? 
        answer: 
          Currently, access through the Power BI Gateway or behind a firewall is unsupported.

      - question: |
          What steps does restarting the Mirroring include? 
        answer: 
           The data from source tables will be reinitialized. Each time you stop and start, the entire table is fetched again.

      - question: |
           What happens if I remove a table from Mirroring?
        answer: 
           The table is no longer replicated and its data is deleted from OneLake.

      - question: |
          If I delete the Mirror, does it affect the source Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server? 
        answer: 
          No, we just remove the replication slot.

      - question: |
          Can I mirror the same source database multiple times? 
        answer: 
          No, each Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server can only be mirrored once. You just need a single copy of the data in Fabric OneLake, which you can share with others.

      - question: |
          Can I mirror only specific tables from my Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server databases? 
        answer: 
          Yes, specific tables can be selected during Mirroring configuration.

      - question: |
          What happens to Mirroring during an HA failover for my Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server? 
        answer: 
          Mirroring is currently not supported for servers with HA enabled.

    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the costs associated with Mirroring?
        answer: 
          There is no compute cost for mirroring data from the source to Fabric OneLake. The Mirroring storage cost is free up to a certain limit based on the purchased compute capacity SKU you provision. Learn more from the Mirroring section in [Microsoft Fabric - Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/).
      - question: |
          What do we recommend a customer do to avoid or reduce Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server costs? 
        answer: 
          See [Plan and manage costs for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server](/azure/azure-sql/database/cost-management). Consider using a dedicated, smaller Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, based on requirements.
      - question: |
          How are ingress fees handled? 
        answer: 
          Fabric doesn't charge for Ingress fees into OneLake for Mirroring.
      - question: |
          How are egress fees handled?
        answer: 
          If the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server is located in a different region from your Fabric capacity, data egress will be charged. If in the same region, there is no data egress.

  - name: Licensing
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are licensing options for Fabric Mirroring? 
        answer:
          A Power BI Premium, Fabric Capacity, or Trial Capacity is required. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Fabric licenses](../enterprise/licenses.md).

  - name: Stop or pause Fabric Mirroring
    questions:

      - question: |
          What are the results of stopping Mirroring?
        answer: 
          Replication stops in the source database, but a copy of the tables is kept in OneLake. Restarting the mirroring results in all data being replicated from the start.

      - question: | 
          What if I stop or pause my Fabric capacity?
        answer: |
          The Fabric capacity needs to be active and running. A paused or deleted capacity will impact Mirroring and no data will be replicated.
