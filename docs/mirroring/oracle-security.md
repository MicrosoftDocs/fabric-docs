# How to: Secure data Microsoft Fabric mirrored databases from Oracle (Preview)

This guide helps you establish data security in your mirrored Oracle in Microsoft Fabric.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

## Security requirements

1. Check the networking requirements to access your Oracle instance data source. [Install an on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install). The gateway machine's network must connect to the Oracle instance via a private endpoint or be allowed by the firewall rule.
    - Resources for data gateways:
        - [Plan, scale, and maintain a business-critical gateway solution](/data-integration/gateway/plan-scale-maintain)
        - [Monitor and optimize on-premises data gateway performance](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-performance)
        - [Troubleshoot the on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-tshoot)
1. Fabric needs to authenticate to the Oracle instance. For information about the required permissions, see [Required Permissions](oracle-limitations.md#required-permissions).
1. To configure mirroring for an Oracle database:
    * Ensure the database is in **ARCHIVELOG** mode and keep it enabled.
    *  Enable **supplemental logging** at the database level, including **primary key supplemental logging**.
    * For every table selected for mirroring, enable **all-columns supplemental logging** at the table level.

    Our system will attempt to apply these settings automatically. If the Oracle user lacks the **ALTER DATABASE** and **ALTER TABLE** privileges, a DBA must enable supplemental logging at both the database and table levelsâ€”adding supplemental log data for the database and enabling full column logging on each table to be mirrored.
    
    For more information, see the [requirements for setting up Oracle mirroring](oracle-limitations.md#required-permissions).


## Data protection features

You can secure column filters and predicate-based row filters on tables to roles and users in Microsoft Fabric:

- [Row-level security in Fabric data warehousing](../data-warehouse/row-level-security.md)
- [Column-level security in Fabric data warehousing](../data-warehouse/column-level-security.md)

You can also mask sensitive data from non-admins using dynamic data masking:
