# Create a KQL database

In Real-Time Intelligence, you interact with your data in the context of [eventhouses](eventhouse.md), databases, and tables. A single workspace can hold multiple Eventhouses, an eventhouse can hold multiple databases, and each database can hold multiple tables.

In this article, you learn how to create a new KQL database. Once your KQL database has data, you can proceed to query your data using Kusto Query Language in a KQL queryset.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)

## Create a new KQL database

1. In the Eventhouse explorer, under **KQL Databases**, select **New database +**.

1. Enter your database name, then select **Create**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The database name can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Special characters aren't supported.

The KQL database is created within the context of the selected eventhouse.

## Database details

The main page of your KQL database shows an overview of the contents in your database. The following table lists the available information.
