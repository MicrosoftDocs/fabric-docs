# Use the Fabric RTI MCP Server with Eventhouse (preview)

Learn how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) Eventhouse to execute KQL queries against the KQL Databases in your Eventhouse backend. The RTI MCP integration provides a unified interface for AI agents to query, reason, and act on real-time data.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

The Fabric RTI MCP Server enables AI agents or AI applications to interact with Eventhouse by providing tools through the MCP interface. This allows you to:

* Query and analyze the data in KQL databases in the Eventhouse.
* Use natural language queries that get translated to KQL queries.
* Discover KQL database schemas and metadata dynamically.
* Sample data.

For the full list of available tools and natural language query examples, see [overview](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-rti-mcp/?tab=readme-ov-file#-overview) in the Fabric RTI MCP Server repository.
