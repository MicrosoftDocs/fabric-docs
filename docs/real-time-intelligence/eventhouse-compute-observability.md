# Understand Eventhouse compute usage
Microsoft Fabric Eventhouse is built to adjust the compute according to your usage patterns, which means that the capacity usage automatically scales to meet your workload requirements.

This article walks you through some of the most common factors that determine the size of your eventhouse compute so that you can make the right decisions to optimize your eventhouse.

## Key factors influencing compute size

Several factors determine the right size for your eventhouse compute.Â By understanding these factors, you can make informed decisions to optimize your usage.

### Cache utilization

The amount of data kept in the hot cache is a main factor affecting the size of your eventhouse compute. Each compute size provides a certain amount of hot cache capacity. As you approach this limit, both compute and cache space increase accordingly. Therefore, it's critical to manage your hot cache [utilization effectively](/kusto/management/cache-policy).

#### Understand capacity level of the current cache 

To understand your current hot cache usage, run the following command:

```
.show diagnostics
| project HotDataDiskSpaceUsage
```

:::image type="content" source="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/show-diagnostics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the show diagnostics command." lightbox="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/show-diagnostics.png":::

This command displays the percentage of hot cache space currently used.

- If the hot cache usage reaches ~95%, your compute scales up to the next level irrelevant of other usage (CPU, ingestion, etc.).
- If the hot cache usage goes under ~35% and all other scale-in factors are met (CPU, ingestion, etc.), your compute scales into the next smaller size. 

To understand where the hot cache is being consumed, drill down to specific tables. Start by running the following command.

```
.show tables details
| summarize HotExtentSize=format\_bytes(sum(HotOriginalSize),2)
```

:::image type="content" source="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/show-table-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the show table details command." lightbox="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/show-table-details.png":::

To adjust the caching policy at the table level, modify the [table-level caching policy](/kusto/management/cache-policy?view=microsoft-fabric&preserve-view=true).

## Ingestion capacity

Another factor in the size of your eventhouse is the ingestion utilization. To ensure timely ingestion, Fabric monitors your ingestion load and adjusts the Eventhouse compute capacity to accommodate the data being ingested.

### Check ingestion load

When looking at the ingestion load, you want to observe it over time. The best way to accomplish it is by enabling [workspace monitoring](../fundamentals/enable-workspace-monitoring.md).

After you enable it, run a query similar to the following query to see your current ingestion load:

```
EventhouseMetrics
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| where ItemName == "FieldDemos"
| where MetricName == "IngestsLoadFactor"
| summarize MinValue=min(MetricMinValue), max(MetricMaxValue) by bin(Timestamp,15m)
| render timechart
```

:::image type="content" source="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/ingestion-load-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a graph showing ingestion load factor over time." lightbox="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/ingestion-load-graph.png":::

This command shows the percentage of the ingestion capacity being used by the current eventhouse compute size. A few takeaways from this number:

- If you're taking up consistently 70% or more of the ingestion capacity at the current size, the compute is sized based on ingestion. It means that unless the ingestion pattern changed, you continue to run at this compute size or larger, irrelevant of other activity.
- If this percentage consistently drops below 70%, it means that the compute is sized based on other factors. They could be the minimum capacity settings, cache utilization, or query load on the eventhouse.

This setting is also available in the [Workspace Monitoring Dashboard](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-template-dashboards-for-workspace-monitoring?ft=All) in the **EH | Table Ingestions** tab.

## Query load

Load and performance of a query factors in the size of compute eventhouse needs. The best way to monitor this performance is to enable [workspace monitoring](../fundamentals/enable-workspace-monitoring.md) and utilize the [Workspace Monitoring Dashboard](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-template-dashboards-for-workspace-monitoring?ft=All).

You can start with the **Eventhouses** tab in the dashboard. The **Eventhouse Queries** section provides

- Query count
- Query status over time
- Applications executing queries
- Most queried databases
- Users running the most queries

:::image type="content" source="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/eventhouse-overview-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Workspace Monitoring Dashboard showing Query Load information." lightbox="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/eventhouse-overview-tab.png":::

To see more detailed information, use the **EH | Queries** tab. This tab gives you the details down to specific queries and provides the following parameters to help you quickly drill down to specific issues.

| Parameter name | Description | 
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Top Queries Table Order | Allows you to order the queries by timestamp, CPU Time, Duration, Cold Storage Access, Memory Peak. |
| Eventhouse Name | Allows you to filter to a specific eventhouse or look across multiple eventhouses. |
| Database Name | Allows you to select the databases you're interested in. |
| Users | Allows you to specify or exclude users. |
| Query Status | Filter based on query state. |
| Application | Allows you to filter to the application that is running the query. |

:::image type="content" source="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/query-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Workspace Monitoring Dashboard showing charts and graphs of Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries over time." lightbox="media/eventhouse-capacity-observability/query-tab.png":::

A couple of common issues that would be easy to spot using this dashboard:

- Filter by Top CPU Time to see what queries might be causing high CPU Utilization.
- Filter by Top Duration to see what queries are taking the longest to execute.
- Filter by Memory Peak to see what queries might be causing memory issues.
- Using **Queries by status over Time** to see if you had a spike in queries.
- Using the Throttled tile to see if the Fabric Capacity throttled any queries.
  
Using this report, you can get down to the specific applications, users, and queries that might need your attention. This article doesn't cover query optimization but finding the actual query text that needs optimization lets you start that process.

### Automate responses

In this article, you walked through observing usage of your eventhouse using control commands, queries against the Workspace Monitoring eventhouse, and using the Workspace Monitoring Dashboard.

To set up notifications from any of these scenarios, use [Activator](data-activator/activator-introduction.md). Activator allows you to respond to your data from multiple locations in Fabric including creating actions from:

- [Real-Time Dashboards](data-activator/activator-get-data-real-time-dashboard.md)
- [KQL Queryset](data-activator/activator-alert-queryset.md)

It gives you the ability to set up actions from KQL querysets for the control commands and from Real-Time Dashboards for the tiles in the Monitoring Dashboard. You can send out emails, messages in Teams, or initialize [Microsoft Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-automate) according to your requirements.

## Summary

Observability for your eventhouse compute is provided using Eventhouse Overview, Database Overview, KQL Database control commands, and the Workspace Monitoring database. In this article, you walked through the most common scenarios and how to use either KQL Database control commands or the Workspace Monitoring database to allow you to understand your compute usage.
