## Create a schema set

1. Select **My workspace** on the left navigation bar.
1. On the **My workspace** page, select **+ New item** on the command bar. 
1. On the **New item** page, search for **Eventstream**, and then select **Eventstream**.

1. Creation of the new event schema set in your workspace can take a few seconds. After the schema set is created, you're directed to the main editor where you can start with adding a schema to the schema set.
