# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 1: Create resources

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Introduction to the Real-Time Intelligence tutorial](tutorial-introduction.md).

In this part of the tutorial, you set up the environment. Specifically, you create an [eventhouse](eventhouse.md), which automatically creates a child KQL database, and then you enable OneLake availability.

## Create an eventhouse

1. Browse to the workspace in which you want to create your tutorial resources.
1. On the bottom left experience switcher, select **Real-Time Intelligence**.
1. In the upper left corner, select **+ New > Eventhouse**.
1. Enter *Tutorial* as the eventhouse name. A KQL database is created simultaneously with the same name.
1. Select **Create**. When provisioning is complete, the eventhouse **System overview** page is shown.

## Turn on OneLake availability

1. From the **System overview** page, select the KQL database you created in the previous step.

1. Toggle the button to **Active** and select **Done**.
