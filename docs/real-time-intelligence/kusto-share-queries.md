# Share queries

In this article, you learn how to share Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries. This includes how to share a query link, share the query results, or pin it to a dashboard. For more information about the query language, see [Kusto Query Language overview](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/index?context=/fabric/context/context).

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A [KQL database](create-database.md) with editing permissions and data.

## Copy query

To copy and share the queries you create, follow these steps:

1. At the top of the query window, select **Copy query**.

    The following table outlines the many options for how to copy a query.

    |Action|Description|
    |--|--|
    |Copy query | Copy the query text.|
    |Link to clipboard|Copy a deep link that can be used to run the query.|
    |Link and query to clipboard|Copy a link that can be used to run the query and the text of the query.|
    |Link, query and results to clipboard|Copy a link that can be used to run the query, the text of the query, and the results of the query.|
    |Copy results|Copy the results of the query.|

1. Select the desired action from the list.
1. Paste this information to edit or share it, for example in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Teams, or Outlook.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The user who is receiving the query link must have viewing permissions to the underlying data to execute the query and view results.

## Use a shared query

To use a shared query, follow these steps:

1. Open the Real-Time Intelligence link that was shared with you. The link opens as an unsaved, temporary query.
1. Run the query or add other steps to the query.
1. Then either:
    1. Close the query without saving it.
    1. Select **Save to** and then **New KQL queryset** or **Existing KQL queryset**.
