# Create materialized views

A materialized view is an aggregation query over a source table, or over another materialized view. It represents a single `summarize` statement. There are two types of materialized views:

* Empty materialized view: it includes records ingested after view creation. A creation of this kind returns immediately, with the view instantly being available for query.
* Materialized view based on existing records in the source table: Creation might take a long while to complete, depending on the number of records in the source table.

For more information on materialized views, see [Materialized view overview](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/materialized-views/materialized-view-overview?context=/fabric/context/context).

In this article, you learn how to create materialized views using the `.create materialized-view` command.

For more information on the `.create materialized-view` command, see [.create materialized-view](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/materialized-views/materialized-view-create?context=/fabric/context/context).

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A [KQL database](create-database.md) with editing permissions

## Materialized view

1. Browse to your KQL database, and select **+New** > **Materialized view**.

    The materialized view command is populated in the **Explore your data** window.

1. Enter the table name and query statement of your materialized view instead of the placeholder text, and then select **Run**.

    Materialized views appear under **Materialized views** in the **Explorer** pane.
