# How to share a map using org apps (preview)

Sharing geospatial insights across an organization is now easier and more secure with Microsoft Fabric org apps. By integrating Fabric Maps into org apps, operation teams and decision-makers can package interactive map artifacts into curated, read-only applications. This approach enables broader audiences, such as field teams and business stakeholders, to explore and respond to spatial data within a governed, scalable environment, ensuring that access permissions are managed and sensitive information remains protected. Org apps streamline the distribution of geospatial intelligence, making it accessible to the right users while maintaining organizational control and compliance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The preview for org apps is off by default for tenants. To enable the preview, you must be a Microsoft Fabric administrator. For more information, see [Prerequisites for creating org app items](/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-items#prerequisites-for-creating-org-app-items)

## Share a map

1. **Create a Fabric org app**
   - In your Fabric workspace, select **New Item** and choose **Org app (preview)**.

2. **Select Content to Include**
   - Add any needed content, including items like Fabric maps, Power BI reports, dashboards, and notebooks.

3. **Define Audience and Permissions**
   - Specify who should have access (individuals, groups, or organization-wide).
   - Set permissions for the app audience by selecting **Share** button in the upper-right side of the window, then **Add person or group**.

   - Reshare and manage access
     - org apps support resharing according to your organization's policies. To enable resharing, select the **Share** checkbox when granting people access.
     - org apps support updating audience access or permissions at any time, according to your organization's policies. To change permissions, select the **Share** button in the upper-right side of the window, then **Manage access**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must also manually grant recipients access to all underlying data sources, such as a lakehouse or eventhouse, for the map to function correctly.

## Best Practices

- When sharing via org apps, always verify recipients have access to all underlying data sources. If recipients lack permissions for underlying data sources, they could encounter access errors
- Monitor for future updates as additions and improvements to features are released.
