# Customize Map (preview)

The Map (preview) in Microsoft Fabric offers a comprehensive set of options for customizing the map and display. By default, the map style is set to Grayscale Light, but you can easily change the map style, apply a data color theme, and toggle the visibility of various map elements. More customization options include adding interactive controls, setting the initial map view, and selecting a display language that best suits the needs of the map's audience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
< This feature is in [preview](../../fundamentals/preview).

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A [map](create-map.md) with editing permissions and connected data sources, either geoJson files in lakehouse, or KQL querysets.

## Customize geometry data

Spatial data is typically represented as points, lines, or polygons. Map offers various visual effects to emphasize business-relevant patterns, relationships, and spatial distributions. The following sections detail how to configure properties for each visual effect type to enhance map readability and analytical value.

### General settings

The following table describes the general settings for data layers.

| Setting | Description |
|--|--|
| Layer color | Defines the base color applied to this data layer. Note: If the "series group" option is enabled, individual series colors override the layer color setting. |
| Tooltips | Specifies which more data properties should be displayed when hovering over map geometries. These properties provide contextual information about the spatial features shown on the map.|
| Zoom level | Defines the range of zoom levels at which map geometries are visible.<br>Note: This setting isn't supported when using PMTiles as the data source. |

### Point geometry

#### Bubble visual

A bubble visual displays individual data points as circles on a geographic map. Each bubble's size, color, and opacity can be customized to represent attributes such as magnitude, category, or intensity. This visualization is ideal for highlighting differences across locations, helping users compare values and spot patterns or outliers in spatial datasets. Bubble layers are especially useful for mapping quantitative data like population, sales volume, or event frequency.

The following screenshot shows EV charging station locations across Washington State. A bubble layer is used to represent the data, which consists of point features. Each station is visualized as a bubble, with size and opacity customized to reflect station-specific attributes.

:::image type="content" source="media/customize-map/bubble-visual.png" lightbox="media/customize-map/bubble-visual.png" alt-text="Screenshot of bubble visual with basic setting.":::

The following table outlines the available bubble visual settings along with their descriptions.

| Setting | Description |
|--|--|
| Opacity | Controls the opacity of point features on the map. Valid range: 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (fully opaque). |
| Stroke width | The numeric value that determines how thick the border of each bubble appears on the map, measured in pixels. Valid values: 0-10. |
| Stroke color | Specifies the color used for the border of each bubble. This helps distinguish bubbles from the map background and can be used to emphasize or categorize data points. |
| Enable series group | Toggle to use color to group and differentiate geometries based on the selected data property. Default: *off*<br>Note: If enabled, the **Layer color** defined in General settings aren't applied. |
| Series group | Select a data property from this drop-down list to group and color-code bubble features. This option is only accessible when the **Enable series group** setting is active. |
| Size | Configure how bubble sizes are displayed on the map:<br> <ul><li>**Fixed Size:** Select a consistent bubble size using a slider ranging from *1px to 50px*. Default = *8px*.</li><li>**Data-Driven Size:** Bubble size adjusts dynamically based on a numeric data property, allowing the size to reflect the magnitude of the underlying data. Only numeric properties are supported.</li></ul> |
| Enable clustering | Groups nearby data points into clusters to reduce visual clutter and improve map readability. Default = *off* |
| Cluster size | Configure size of clustered bubble, Support **fixed value**, users can configure clustered bubble size from 1px to 50px. Default = *16px*|
| Aggregate by | The "Aggregate by" property allows users to select a numeric data field from a dropdown list to group and categorize bubble data. This feature is only applicable when working with numeric properties and is typically used to summarize or visualize aggregated values across spatial features. |
| Aggregation | Select a method for summarizing data based on the chosen numeric property. Available options include:<br><ul><li>**Sum** – Adds all values together</li><li>**Average** – Calculates the mean of values</li><li>**Minimum** – Displays the smallest value in the group</li><li>**Maximum** – Displays the largest value in the group</li><li>**Count** – Tallies the number of data points in the group</li></ul> |

##### Enable series group

#### Heat map visual

Heat maps, or point density maps, use color gradients to visualize where data points are most concentrated. They highlight high-density areas ("hot spots") and make spatial patterns easier to detect. This method is especially effective for large datasets, converting raw data into a smooth, continuous surface that reveals both absolute and relative densities across geographic regions.

:::image type="content" source="media/customize-map/heatmap-visual-default.png" lightbox="media/customize-map/heatmap-visual-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot of heatmap visual with default setting.":::

The following table describes the available heat map visual settings.

| Setting | Description |
|--|--|
| Color gradient | The color theme for displaying hot spots of the data |
| Opacity | The opacity of heat map visual. Valid values range from 1% to 100%. Default = *100%* |
|  Intensity | Adjusts the multiplier applied to each data point's weight to control heatmap intensity. Valid values range from 1% to 100%. Default = *1%* |
| Radius | Specifies the pixel radius used to render each data point in the heat map layer. This determines how far the influence of each point spreads visually. Valid values range from 1 to 100. Default = *30*|
| Weight | Set the weight of each point using a numeric data property. Default = *1* |
| Enable clustering | Groups nearby data points into clusters to reduce visual clutter and improve map readability. Default = *off* |

##### Apply weight

The following screenshot illustrates a taxi trip heat map of New York City. Each trip is represented as a data point, with the fare_amount used as a weight, meaning areas with higher fares contribute more intensity to the heat map. To enhance readability, lower opacity is applied, allowing the map and overlapping data to remain visible.

:::image type="content" source="media/customize-map/heatmap-visual-with-weight.png" lightbox="media/customize-map/heatmap-visual-with-weight.png" alt-text="Screenshot of heatmap visual with weight property configured.":::

##### Enable clustering

The following screenshot illustrates a clustered heat map that visualizes spatial data density. By fine-tuning parameters such as radius and intensity, the map more effectively reveals patterns that are obscured by overlapping data points.

:::image type="content" source="media/customize-map/heatmap-visual-clustering.png" lightbox="media/customize-map/heatmap-visual-clustering.png" alt-text="Screenshot of heatmap visual enable clustering.":::

### Line geometry

#### Line visual

Line visual is used to visualize linear geographic features such as roads, paths, routes, or boundaries on a map. It connects a series of coordinates to form lines, which can be styled with various attributes like color, stroke width. This type of visual is especially useful for representing movement, direction, or connections between locations, and is commonly applied in scenarios like route planning, infrastructure mapping, or network visualization.

The following screenshot shows national forest trails near by Mount Rainier.

:::image type="content" source="media/customize-map/line-visual-basic.png" lightbox="media/customize-map/line-visual-basic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of line visual basic.":::

The following table describes the available line visual setting and description.

| Setting | Description |
|--|--|
| Stroke opacity | The opacity of line features. Valid values range from 1% to 100%. Default = *100%* |
| Stroke width | The width of lines measured in pixels. Valid values: 0-10. Default = *3px* |
| Enable series group | Toggle to use color to group and differentiate geometries based on the selected data property. Default: *off*<br>Note: If enabled, the **Layer color** defined in General settings aren't applied. |
| Series group | Select a data property from this drop-down list to group and color-code lines. This option is only accessible when the **Enable series group** setting is active. |

##### Enable series group

The following screenshot shows national forest trail data near by Mount Rainier. Enable series group and use data property ```ATV_RESTRICTED``` to identify trails that restricts ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicle).

### Polygon geometry

#### Polygon visual

Polygon visual is used to visualize areas or regions by connecting multiple geographic coordinates to form enclosed shapes. These polygons can represent boundaries such as city limits, zones, or regions of interest. You can customize the appearance of these shapes using attributes like layer color, and opacity. This visual is useful for highlighting specific geographic areas and analyzing spatial relationships or coverage.

The following screenshot displays a historical fire perimeters map of California, showing the geographic extent of past wildfires using red polygons. Each polygon represents a distinct fire event and includes metadata such as the year, cause, and GIS-calculated acreage. This visualization enables users to quickly identify fire-prone areas, analyze historical fire patterns, and support wildfire mitigation and land management planning.

The following table describes the available polygon visual setting and description.

| Setting | Description |
|--|--|
| Fill opacity | The opacity of polygon features on the map. Valid range: 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (fully opaque). Default = *60%* |
| Enable series group | Toggle to use color to group and differentiate geometries based on the selected data property. Default: *off*<br>Note: If enabled, the **Layer color** defined in General settings aren't applied. |
| Series group | Select a data property from this drop-down list to group and color-code lines. This option is only accessible when the **Enable series group** setting is active. |
| Enable extrusion | This property allows polygons to be rendered in 3D by applying height based on a numeric field. It enhances spatial visualization by adding depth and volume to flat shapes. Default = *off*.|
| Height | Specifies the numeric data field used to determine the vertical extrusion of each polygon. This option is only accessible when the **Enable extrusion** setting is active. |

##### Enable series group

The following screenshot displays a thematic map of California highlighting historic fire perimeters using the polygon visual. Each fire-affected area is color-coded according to the *DECADES* field, enabling viewers to distinguish wildfire events by time periods such as 1960–1969, 1970–1979, and beyond.
