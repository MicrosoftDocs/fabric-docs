# Manage Map permissions (preview)

Permissions for reading, writing, and sharing Map items follow the standard Fabric workspace roles, ensuring a consistent and secure access model across all Fabric items.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is in [preview](../../fundamentals/preview.md).

## Workspace roles for Map items

The following table shows the default permissions assigned to each Fabric workspace role for Map items.

| Permissions                     | Administrator | Member | Contributor | Viewer |
|---------------------------------|:-------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| View and read Map Item content  | ✔️            | ✔️    | ✔️          | ✔️    |
| Create, edit, and delete Map    | ✔️            | ✔️    | ✔️          | ❌    |
| Share Map                       | ✔️            | ✔️    | ❌          | ❌    |

## Managing Map Permissions

To manage Map permissions

1. In your workspace, select the ellipsis (...) next to the Map name.
2. Select **Manage permissions**.
3. In the **Direct access** panel, you can:
   - View current recipients and their permissions.
   - Revoke or modify access.
   - Add new users and specify roles.

## Permissions required for related items

Map items depend on other Fabric items, such as Lakehouse or KQL Database. To build and use a Map, you must also have the appropriate permissions on these related items.

| Use Case           | Related items           | Related item permissions required               |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Builder and Viewer roles access the full GeoJSON data for tile generation. | Lakehouse  | Read |
| Builder uploads PM Tiles to Lakehouse                                      | Lakehouse  | Write|
| Builder access KQL DB and query set and read the result. | KQL Database  | Write |
| Users view the content in the Map item    | KQL Database | Write |

> [!NOTE]
>
> When users lack permission to access the Lakehouse or KQL Database, the map displays errors or incomplete data. Map access depends on the permissions of the underlying data. Shared maps only show information the user is authorized to view.
