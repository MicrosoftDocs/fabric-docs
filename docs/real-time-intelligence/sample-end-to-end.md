# End-to-end sample

This article explains how to use the End-to-end sample solution to automatically create a collection of sample components. It lets you explore the main features of Real-Time Intelligence with sample data. It provides a comprehensive end-to-end solution, demonstrating how Real-Time Intelligence components work together to stream, analyze, visualize, and alert real-time data in a real-world context.

> [!Tip]
> To implement this solution with your data, follow the [end-to-end tutorial](tutorial-introduction.md).

The sample data sets help you understand how to use Real-Time Intelligence components. The sample data sets include:

* **Bike rental data**: Contains London-based bike movements, occupancies, and tracks user patterns.
* **Stock ticker data**: Contains sample S&P 500 stock ticker data.

## Components of the end-to-end sample

The sample end-to-end solution includes these components:

* **Eventstream**: An Eventstream is the engine for data ingestion and processing of your real-time data into Microsoft Fabric. You can transform your data and route it via filters to various destinations. Read more about [event streams](event-streams/overview.md).

* **Eventhouse**: An Eventhouse is where data is stored and analyzed. An Eventhouse is designed to handle real-time data streams efficiently. An Eventhouse can hold one or more KQL databases. They're tailored to large volumes of time-based, streaming events with structured, semi structured, and unstructured data. Read more about [Eventhouse](eventhouse.md).

* **KQL Database**: A KQL Database is where data is stored and managed. It allows you to query data in real-time, providing a powerful tool for data exploration and analysis. The KQL database supports various data policies and transformations. Read more about [KQL databases](create-database.md).

* **KQL Queryset**: A KQL Queryset is used to run queries, view, and customize query results on data from a [KQL queryset](create-query-set.md).

* **Real-Time Dashboard**: A Real-Time Dashboard provides an up-to-the-second snapshot of various goals and data points in a collection of tiles. Each tile has an underlying query and a visual representation. It allows you to visualize data in real-time, providing insights and enabling data exploration. Read more about [Real-Time dashboards](dashboard-real-time-create.md).

* **Power BI**: is used to create real-time reports that display data from Eventstreams and KQL Databases managed by Real-Time Intelligence.

* **Activator**: is a no-code experience in Microsoft Fabric for automatically taking actions when patterns or conditions are detected in changing data.

## Create an end-to-end sample

These steps show how to create an end-to-end sample using the bike rental sample data.

1. Select **Real-Time** from the left navigation bar. The **Real-Time hub** opens.

1. On the **Jumpstart your experience using sample scenarios** section, click the **Bicycle rentals** tile.

1. In the **Create samples** window, select **Get started** with bike rental data.

1. Select the sample items to create. By default, all items are selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Real-time Dashboard, Report, Queryset, and Activator are optional and can be cleared. However, we recommend creating the entire component set for the best experience.

1. Set the **Destination Location** for the sample components. By default, the items are created in the current workspace. Select a different workspace from the dropdown list if needed.

1. Select **Create** to create the sample components. The progress window shows the status of the creation process.

1. When the sample data is ready, start exploring by selecting **Open Eventhouse** or **Open Folder**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-end-to-end-solution/end-to-end-sample-navigate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the interface with Open Eventhouse and Open Folder buttons.":::

1. To explore the sample data at any time, open the workspace and browse to the **Bike_sample** folder.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-end-to-end-solution/end-to-end-sample-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Bike_sample folder in the workspace containing the Eventhouse, Eventstream, Queryset, and Dashboard.":::

1. Select **Bike_Eventhouse**, **Bike_Eventstream**, **Bike_Queryset**, **Bike_Activator**, or **Bike_Dashboard** and explore the sample data. After you open each item for the first time, it appears in the left navigation bar for easy access.
