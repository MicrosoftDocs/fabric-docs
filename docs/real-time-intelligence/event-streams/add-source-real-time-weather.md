# Add a real-time weather source to an eventstream

You can add a real-time weather source to an eventstream to stream real-time weather data from different locations. This source allows you to select specific city or latitude and longitude coordinates to receive weather information. This article shows you how to add a real-time weather source to an eventstream.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- If you don't have an eventstream, [create an eventstream](create-manage-an-eventstream.md). 

## Add a real-time weather as a source

[!INCLUDE [launch-connect-external-source](./includes/launch-connect-external-source.md)]

On the **Select a data source** page, search for and select **Connect** on the **real-time weather** tile.

## Configure real-time weather

[!INCLUDE [real-time-weather](./includes/real-time-weather.md)]

## View updated eventstream
1. You see the real-time weather source added to your eventstream in **Edit mode**. Select **Publish** to publish the changes and begin streaming real-time weather data to the eventstream.
