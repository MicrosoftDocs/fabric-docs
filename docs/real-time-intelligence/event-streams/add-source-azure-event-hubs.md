# Add Azure Event Hubs source to an eventstream
This article shows you how to add an Azure Event Hubs source to an eventstream. 

[!INCLUDE [select-view](./includes/select-view.md)]

::: zone pivot="enhanced-capabilities"  

## Prerequisites 
Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites: 

- Get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your eventstream is located. 
- You need to have appropriate permission to get event hub's access keys. The event hub must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.

## Add Azure Event Hubs as a source 
If you have an Azure event hub created with streaming data, follow these steps to add an Azure event hub as your eventstream source: 

1. Create an eventstream with enhanced capabilities. 
1. If you haven't added any source to your eventstream yet, select **Add external source** on the **Get started** page.

    If you're adding an Azure event hub as a source to an already published eventstream, switch to **Edit** mode, select **Add source** on the ribbon, and then select **External sources**.

## Configure Azure Event Hubs connector
[!INCLUDE [azure-event-hubs-connector](./includes/azure-event-hubs-source-connector.md)]

You see that the Event Hubs source is added to your eventstream on the canvas in the **Edit** mode. To implement this newly added Azure event hub, select **Publish** on the ribbon.

After you complete these steps, the Azure event hub is available for visualization in the **Live view**. Select the **Event hub** tile in the diagram to see the page similar to the following one.

## Add an Azure event hub as a source

If you have an Azure event hub created with streaming data, follow these steps to add an Azure event hub as your eventstream source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Azure Event Hubs**.

1. Enter a source name for the new source and select a cloud connection to your Azure event hub.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-event-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure Event Hubs source configuration.":::

1. If you don’t have a cloud connection, select **Create new connection** to create one. To create a new connection, fill in the **Connection settings** and **Connection credentials** of your Azure event hub, and then select **Create**.

   - **Event Hub namespace**: Enter the name of your Azure event hub namespace.
   - **Event Hub**: Enter the name of your Azure event hub in the Azure portal.
   - **Connection name**: Enter a name for the cloud connection.
   - **Shared access key name** and **Shared access key**: Go to your Azure event hub and create a policy with `Manage` or `Listen` permission under **Share access policies**. Then use **policy name** and **primary key** as the **Shared Access Key Name** and **Shared Access Key**.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/azure-event-hub-policy-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure event hub policy key." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/azure-event-hub-policy-key.png":::

1. After you create a cloud connection, select the refresh button, and then select the cloud connection you created.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/cloud-connection-refresh.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the cloud connection refresh.":::

1. Select a **Data format** of the incoming real-time events that you want to get from your Azure event hub.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The event streams feature supports the ingestion of events from Azure Event Hubs in JSON, Avro, and CSV (with header) data formats.

1. Select a **Consumer group** that can read the event data from your Azure event hub and then select **Add**.

After you have created the event hub source, you see it added to your eventstream on the canvas.
