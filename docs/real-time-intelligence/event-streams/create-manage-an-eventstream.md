# Create an eventstream in Microsoft Fabric
This article describes how to create a Fabric eventstream. The enhanced capabilities are enabled by default now, so use the content in the **Enhanced Capabilities** tab to create an eventstream.

If you have eventstreams that were created using standard capabilities, those eventstreams will continue to work. You can still edit and publish them as usual. We recommend that you create a new eventstream to replace standard eventstreams so that you can take advantage of additional capabilities and benefits of enhanced eventstreams.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisite:

- Get access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions.


## Create an eventstream

[!INCLUDE [create-an-eventstream](./includes/create-an-eventstream.md)]

## Next step
- [Add sources to the eventstream](./add-manage-eventstream-sources.md)
- [Add destinations to the eventstream](./add-manage-eventstream-destinations.md)
