# Pause and resume data streams (preview)

The Pause and Resume features in Eventstream give you a full control over your data streams, enabling you to pause data streaming from various sources and destinations within Eventstream. You can then resume data streaming seamlessly from the paused time or a customized time, ensuring no data loss.

* **Activate/Deactivate All**: Quickly pause and resume all data traffic flowing in and out of Eventstream using the Activate All and Deactivate All options on the menu bar.
* **Toggle Switch Button**: Each node has a toggle switch button, allowing you to activate or deactivate the data streaming from or to selected sources and destinations.

Here are the data sources that currently support Traffic Pause and Resume:

* **Sources**: Sample data, Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub
* **Destinations**: Lakehouse, KQL Database (with Event Processor)

The following table outlines the description of different node statuses:

| Node Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Active | Data source is currently active and data is flowing in or out of Eventstream. |
| Inactive | Data source is currently inactive, and no data is flowing in or out of Eventstream. |
| Loading | Data source is in the process of being turned on or off. |
| Error | Data source is currently paused due to errors.  |
| Warning | Data source is operational but experiencing some issues, although data traffic is still occurring. |

## Activating or deactivating node using the switch toggle

For nodes that support pause and resume features, you can easily manage their data flow using the toggle switch. Simply find the desired node and toggle the switch on or off to activate or deactivate the data traffic. If a node doesn't currently support pause and resume functionality, the toggle switch will be disabled.

## Activating or deactivating all nodes

You can easily pause or resume all data traffic within Eventstream by selecting either the **Activate All** or **Deactivate All** option from the menu bar. This action will either resume or pause all data traffic flowing in or out of Eventstream. Note that it only applies to nodes that support pause and resume functionality. For nodes that do not currently support this feature, data traffic cannot be paused.
