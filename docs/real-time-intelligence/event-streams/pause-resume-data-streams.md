# Pause and resume data streams (preview)

[!INCLUDE [select-view](./includes/select-view.md)]

The **Pause** and **Resume** (that is, **Deactivate** and **Activate**) features in Eventstream give you a full control over your data streams, enabling you to pause data streaming from various sources and destinations within Eventstream. You can then resume data streaming seamlessly from the paused time or a customized time, ensuring no data loss.

* **Activate/Deactivate All**: Quickly pause and resume all data traffic flowing in and out of Eventstream using the Activate All and Deactivate All options on the menu bar.
* **Activate/Deactivate Toggle Switch Button**: Each node has a toggle switch button, allowing you to activate (that is, resume) or deactivate (that is, pause) the data streaming from or to selected sources and destinations.

The following table outlines the description of different node statuses:

| Node Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Active | Data source is currently active and data is flowing in or out of Eventstream. |
| Inactive | Data source is currently inactive, and no data is flowing in or out of Eventstream. |
| Loading | Data source is in the process of being turned on or off. |
| Error | Data source is currently paused due to errors.  |
| Warning | Data source is operational but experiencing some issues, although data traffic is still occurring. |

## Activating or deactivating a node using the switch toggle

For nodes that support pause and resume features, you can easily manage their data flow using the toggle switch. Find the desired node and toggle the switch on or off to activate (that is, resume) or deactivate (that is, pause) the data traffic. Nodes that don't currently support pause and resume functionality won't have a toggle switch.

The table below describes the available resume options:

| Resume Option                 | Description                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| When streaming was last stopped | Resumes from the point where streaming was last stopped |
| Now                           | Resumes from the current time                |
| Custom time                   | Resumes from a customized time |

> [!NOTE]  
> When configuring an Eventstream, the source, transformation logic, and destination are typically added together. By default, when publishing the Eventstream, the backend services for both data ingestion and data routing start with **Now** respectively. However, data ingestion may begin faster than data routing, causing some data to be ingested into Eventstream before routing is fully initialized. As a result, this data may not be routed to the destination.  
>  
> A common example is a database CDC source, where some initial snapshot data could remain in Eventstream without being routed to the destination.  
>  
> To mitigate this, follow these steps:  
> 1. When configuring an **Eventhouse (Event processing before ingestion)** or **Lakehouse** destination, uncheck **Activate ingestion** after adding the data source.

> 1. Manually activate ingestion after the Eventstream is published.  
> 1. Use the **Custom time** option to select an earlier timestamp, ensuring initial data is properly processed and routed.

## Activating or deactivating all nodes

You can easily pause or resume all data traffic within Eventstream by selecting either the **Activate All** or **Deactivate All** option from the menu bar. When selecting **Activate All**, the available resume options may differ based on the sources and destinations configured in your eventstream. Refer to the detailed table in the previous section for specific resume options for each node. This action will either resume or pause all data traffic flowing in or out of Eventstream. It only applies to nodes that support pause and resume functionality. For nodes that don't currently support this feature, data traffic can't be paused.
