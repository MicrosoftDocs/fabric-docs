# Tutorial: Explore and transform sample bike-sharing data with Eventstream for KQL Database integration

Eventstream is a streaming platform that allows you to ingest, transform, and route data streams to KQL Database using a no-code editor. In this tutorial, we explore sample bike-sharing data to determine the minute-by-minute count of bikes rented on the streets. You learn to use Eventstream's event processor for real-time data transformations and seamlessly directing the processed data to your KQL Database.

## Prerequisites

* Access to a premium workspace with **Contributor** or above permissions where your Eventstream and KQL Database are located.
* A KQL Database created in your workspace.

## Create an eventstream and add sample bike data

Follow these steps to create an eventstream in your workspace:

1. Switch your Power BI experience to **Real-Time Intelligence** and select the **Eventstream** button to create a new one.
2. Name your Eventstream "eventstream-1" and select **Create**.

3. On the Eventstream canvas, expand **New source** and select **Sample data**. Give a name to the source and select **Bicycles** as the sample data.

4. You can preview the data in eventstream to verify if the sample bike data is added successfully.

    Here's the description of the columns:

    | Column          | Description                               |
    | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | BikepointID     | ID for the bike docking point       |
    | Street          | Name of the street where the dock is located|
    | Neighbourhood   | Neighbourhood where the dock is located|
    | Latitude        | Latitude of the docking point   |
    | Longitude       | Longitude of the docking point  |
    | No_Bikes        | Number of bikes currently rented            |
    | No_Empty_Docks  | Number of available empty docks at the docking point|

## Add a KQL destination with event processor

1. On the Eventstream canvas, expand the **New destination** drop-down menu and choose **KQL Database**. Enter the necessary details of your KQL Database.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/transform-sample-data-and-to-kql/add-kql-db.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where add KQL Database in eventstream." lightbox="./media/transform-sample-data-and-to-kql/add-kql-db.png":::

    * **Data ingestion mode**. There are two ways of ingesting data into KQL Database:
        * **Direct ingestion**: Ingest data directly to a KQL table without any transformation.
        * **Event processing before ingestion**: Transform the data with Event Processor before sending to a KQL table.
        > [!NOTE]
        > You CANNOT edit the ingestion mode once the KQL database destination is added to the eventstream.
    * **Destination name**: Enter a name for this Eventstream destination, such as "kql-dest."
    * **Workspace**: Where your KQL database is located.
    * **KQL database**: Name of your KQL Database.
    * **Destination table**: Name of your KQL table. You can also enter a name to create a new table for example "bike-count."
    * **Input data format**: Choose **JSON** as the data format for your KQL table.

2. In the right pane, scroll down and select **Open event processor**. This action opens a new frame allowing you to add real-time operations to your data streams using a no-code editor.

3. On the **Event processing editor**, select the line between Eventstream and the KQL Database, and add a **Group by** operation. Our goal is to calculate the number of bikes rented every minute on the street. Under **Aggregation**, select **SUM** for the aggregation and **No_Bikes** for the field.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/transform-sample-data-and-to-kql/configure-group-by.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to group by operation in Eventstream." lightbox="./media/transform-sample-data-and-to-kql/configure-group-by.png":::

    Further down in the **Settings** section, enter the following information and select **Save** to complete the Group by configuration.
    * **Group aggregation by**: Street
    * **Time window**: Tumbling
    * **Duration**: 1 Minute

4. Select the **Group by** operation on the editor and preview the processing result. Then select **Save** to close the Event processor.

5. Finally, select **Add** to finish the configuration for KQL database destination.

## View result in the KQL table

Now the KQL Database destination is added to your Eventstream. Let's ensure that the processing results are appropriately stored in the designated KQL table. Follow these steps:

1. On the canvas, select the KQL destination, and select **Open item** to access your KQL Database.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/transform-sample-data-and-to-kql/open-kql-db.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to open KQL Database in Eventstream." lightbox="./media/transform-sample-data-and-to-kql/open-kql-db.png":::

2. Within the KQL database interface, locate the **bike-count** table. Select on **Query table** and choose **Show any 100 records**. This action opens the right pane, allowing you to examine the last 100 records of the table. Here, you can observe the detailed count of bikes rented on each street, minute-by-minute.
