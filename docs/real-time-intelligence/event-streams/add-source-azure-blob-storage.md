# Add Azure Blob Storage event source to an eventstream

This article shows you how to add an Azure Blob Storage event source to an eventstream. An event is the smallest amount of information that fully describes something that happened in a system. Azure Blob Storage events are triggered when a client creates, replaces, or deletes a blob. Microsoft Fabric event streams allow you to link Blob Storage events to Fabric events in Real-Time hub.

When you add Azure Blob Storage events as an eventstream source, it automatically creates system events to your Blob Storage account and links them to Fabric events in Real-Time hub. You can then convert these events into continuous data streams and transform them before routing them to various destinations in Fabric.

Fabric event streams support the following Blob Storage event types:

|Event name|Description|
|-------|------------|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated|Triggered when a blob is created or replaced.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted                    |Triggered when a blob is deleted.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed                    |Triggered when a blob is renamed.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobTierChanged                |Triggered when the blob access tier is changed.|
|Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryCreated               |Triggered when a directory is created.|
|Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryRenamed               |Triggered when a directory is renamed.|
|Microsoft.Storage.AsyncOperationInitiated        |Triggered when an operation involving moving or copying data from the archive to hot or cool tiers is initiated.|
|Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryDeleted               |Triggered when a directory is deleted.|
|Microsoft.Storage.BlobInventoryPolicyCompleted   |Triggered when the inventory run completes for a rule that defines an inventory policy.|
|Microsoft.Storage.LifecyclePolicyCompleted       |Triggered when the actions defined by a lifecycle management policy are done.|

For more information about available event types, see [Azure Blob Storage as Event Grid source](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-blob-storage).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Blob Storage events connector is **not supported** in the following workspace capacity regions: Central US, Germany West Central, South-Central US, West US2, West US3, West India.

## Unstreamed vs. streamed events

Azure Blob Storage events are discrete events with clear start and end points. Fabric Real-Time hubs can capture these events in two formats:

- **Unstreamed events.** These events are represented in their raw format as discrete events. If Azure Blob Storage events aren't streamed in an eventstream, they're not directly connected to the eventstream, and the default stream isn't created.

  This status indicates that the events are linked to Fabric events in the Real-Time hub and awaiting further action. Actions include creating alerts with Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] that execute Fabric job items like Pipeline or Notebook in the **Fabric events** tab in Real-Time hub.

- **Streamed events.** These events are converted to continuous events, enabling real-time transformation and routing to various destinations in Fabric for further analysis. In an eventstream, selecting the **Stream events** button on an unstreamed Azure Blob Storage source converts the events into continuous events. The eventstream is then assigned a default stream, letting you add operations and route it to other destinations in Fabric.

  :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/streamed.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing streamed Azure Blob Storage events in an eventstream.":::

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- Access to an Azure Blob Storage **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**, **BlockBlobStorage**, or **BlobStorage** account. The **Storage (general purpose v1)** storage type doesn't support integration with Fabric event streams.
- If you don't have an eventstream, [create an eventstream](create-manage-an-eventstream.md). 


## Add Azure Blob Storage events as source

[!INCLUDE [launch-connect-external-source](./includes/launch-connect-external-source.md)]

On the **Select a data source** page, search for and select **Connect** on the **Azure Blob Storage events** tile.

:::image type="content" source="./media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/select-azure-blob-storage-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the selection of Azure Blob Storage events as the source type in the Select a data source window.":::


## Configure and connect to Azure Blob Storage events

[!INCLUDE [azure-blob-storage-connector](includes/azure-blob-storage-source-connector.md)]

## View updated eventstream

1. Once the connection is created, you can see the Azure Blob Storage event source added to your eventstream in **Edit mode**. Select **Publish** to publish the eventstream and start capturing your Azure Blob Storage events.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/edit.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Azure Blob Storage events source added to the eventstream." lightbox="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/edit.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Eventstream node in the editor doesn't have a default stream created. This is because the Blob Storage events are still in the form of discrete events and aren't yet converted to a stream or connected to the eventstream.
1. If you want to transform the Fabric workspace events, open your eventstream and select **Edit** to enter **Edit mode**. Then you can add operations to transform the Fabric workspace events or route them to a destination such as Lakehouse.

## Transform Azure Blob Storage events

After you link Azure Blob Storage events to Fabric events in Real-Time hub, you can convert these events into a stream and do transformations within eventstreams.

1. After you add an Azure Blob Storage event source in **Edit mode**, select **Stream events** in the source to convert the Blob Storage events into a data stream.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/unstreamed.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the unstreamed event source in Edit mode with Stream events highlighted.":::

1. Respond **Yes** to the popup that asks if you want to stream the Blob Storage events into the eventstream.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/popup.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the confirmation popup for streaming events.":::

1. In the editor, a default stream is created within the eventstream node, indicating that the Blob Storage events are converted into a stream as the default stream.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/default-stream.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the eventstream in Edit Mode showing the default stream.":::

1. **Publish** the eventstream and make sure there's at least one event being triggered from your Azure Blob Storage in order to proceed with transformation or routing.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/published.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the published eventstream in Live View.":::

1. Once events are flowing into the eventstream, enter **Edit mode** and add operations to transform the streamed Blob Storage events. The following example shows that the Blob Storage events are aggregated and routed to a KQL database.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/transform.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the transformed eventstream in Edit Mode.":::

1. Once the changes are published, the streamed Azure Blob Storage events are transformed and routed to the designated destination in Fabric.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/live.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the transformed eventstream in Live Mode showing the default stream.":::

   You can also view the data stream on the **My data streams** tab of **Real-Time hub** for verification.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/hub.png" lightbox="media/add-source-azure-blob-storage/hub.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the eventstream listed under Data streams in the Real-Time hub.":::
