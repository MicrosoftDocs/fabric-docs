# Add Azure IoT Hub source to an eventstream

This article shows you how to add an Azure IoT Hub source to a Microsoft Fabric eventstream.

[!INCLUDE [select-view](./includes/select-view.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode or trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions.  
- Appropriate permission to get your IoT hub's access keys. If your IoT hub is within a protected network, [connect to it by using a managed private endpoint](set-up-private-endpoint.md). Otherwise, ensure that the IoT hub is publicly accessible and not behind a firewall.
- An eventstream. If you don't have an eventstream, [create one](create-manage-an-eventstream.md).

## Start the wizard for selecting a data source

[!INCLUDE [launch-connect-external-source](./includes/launch-connect-external-source.md)]

On the **Select a data source** page, search for **Azure IoT Hub**. On the **Azure IoT Hub** tile, select **Connect**.

## Configure an Azure IoT Hub connector

[!INCLUDE [azure-iot-hub-connector](./includes/azure-iot-hub-source-connector.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sources-destinations-note](./includes/sources-destinations-note.md)]

## View an updated eventstream

1. Confirm that the Azure IoT Hub source is added to your eventstream on the canvas in the **Edit** mode. To implement this newly added IoT hub, select **Publish** on the ribbon.
