# Add Azure IoT Hub source to an eventstream
This article shows you how to add an Azure IoT Hub source to an eventstream. 

[!INCLUDE [select-view](./includes/select-view.md)]

::: zone pivot="enhanced-capabilities"  

## Prerequisites 
Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites: 

- Get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your eventstream is located. 
- You need to have appropriate permission to get IoT hub's access keys. The IoT hub must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.

## Add Azure IoT Hub as a source 
Follow these steps to add an Azure IoT hub as your eventstream source: 

1. Create an eventstream with enhanced capabilities. 
1. If you haven't added any source to your eventstream yet, select **Add external source** on the **Get started** page.

    If you're adding an Azure IoT hub as a source to an already published eventstream, switch to **Edit** mode, select **Add source** on the ribbon, and then select **External sources**.

## Configure Azure IoT Hub connector

[!INCLUDE [azure-iot-hub-connector](./includes/azure-iot-hub-source-connector.md)]

You see that the Azure IoT Hub source is added to your eventstream on the canvas in the **Edit** mode. To implement this newly added Azure IoT hub, select **Publish** on the ribbon.

:::image type="content" source="./media/add-source-azure-iot-hub-enhanced/publish.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the editor with Publish button selected.":::
    
After you complete these steps, the Azure IoT hub is available for visualization in the **Live view**. Select the **IoT hub** tile in the diagram to see the page similar to the following one.

## Add an Azure IoT hub as a source

Follow these steps to add an Azure IoT hub as your eventstream source:

1. In the Eventstream editor, expand the **New source** drop-down menu within the node and choose **Azure IoT Hub**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-iot-hub-source/add-iot-hub-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to add an Azure IoT Hub source in the eventstream.":::

2. On the **Azure IoT Hub** configuration pane, enter the following details:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-iot-hub-source/iot-hub-configuration-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to configure Azure IoT Hub in the eventstream.":::

    1. **Source name**: Enter a name for your Azure IoT Hub, such as **iothub-source**.
    2. **Cloud connection**: Select an existing cloud connection that links your Azure IoT Hub to Microsoft Fabric. If you don't have one, proceed to step 3 to create a new cloud connection.
    3. **Data format**. Choose a data format (AVRO, JSON, or CSV) for streaming your IoT Hub data into the eventstream.
    4. **Consumer group**. Choose a consumer group from your Azure IoT Hub, or leave it as **$Default**. Then select **Add** to finish the Azure IoT Hub configuration.
    5. Once it's added successfully, you can see an Azure IoT Hub source added to your eventstream in the editor.

3. To create a new cloud connection for your Azure IoT Hub, follow these steps:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-iot-hub-source/create-new-cloud-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to create a new cloud connection.":::

    1. Select **Create new connection** from the drop-down menu, fill in the **Connection settings** and **Connection credentials** of your Azure IoT Hub, and then select **Create**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/add-iot-hub-source/add-new-cloud-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to configure a new cloud connection." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/eventstream-eventhub-source-cloud-connection.png":::

    2. **IoT Hub**. Enter the name of the IoT Hub in the Azure portal.
    3. **Connection name**. Enter a name for the new cloud connection, such as **iothub-connection**.
    4. **Shared access key name** and **Shared access key**. Enter the connection credentials for your Azure IoT Hub. You can find it under **Shared access policies** in the Azure portal. You must have appropriate permissions to access any of the IoT Hub endpoints.

    5. Return to the Azure IoT Hub configuration pane and select **Refresh** to load the new cloud connection.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/add-iot-hub-source/refresh-iot-hub-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to refresh the cloud connection for Azure IoT Hub.":::

Once the Azure IoT Hub is added to your eventstream, select **Preview data** to verify successful configuration. You should be able to preview incoming data to your eventstream.
