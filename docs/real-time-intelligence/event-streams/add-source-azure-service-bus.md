# Add an Azure Service Bus source to an eventstream (preview)

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish/subscribe topics. You can use Microsoft Fabric eventstreams to connect to Service Bus. Messages in Service Bus can be fetched into a Fabric eventstream and routed to various destinations within Fabric.

This article shows you how to add a Service Bus source to an eventstream.

> [!NOTE]
> This source is not supported in the following regions of your workspace capacity: West US3, Switzerland West.  

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode or trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions.  
- Appropriate permission to get access keys for the Service Bus namespace, queues, or topics. The Service Bus namespace must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.
- An eventstream. If you don't have an eventstream, [create one](create-manage-an-eventstream.md).

## Start the wizard for selecting a data source

[!INCLUDE [launch-connect-external-source](./includes/launch-connect-external-source.md)]

On the **Select a data source** page, search for **Azure Service Bus**. On the **Azure Service Bus** tile, select **Connect**.

## Configure a Service Bus connector
