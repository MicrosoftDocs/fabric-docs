# Build a Power BI report by streaming events from Azure IoT Hub to Microsoft Fabric

If you have IoT devices that are connected to your Azure IoT Hub, you can ingest and transform your IoT data using Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric. In this tutorial, we walk you through the process of setting up an eventstream to ingest real-time data from Azure IoT Hub to Kusto database. You learn to build a Power BI report to monitor the health of your IoT devices in real time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Access to a premium workspace with **Contributor** or above permissions where your Eventstream and KQL database are located.
- An Azure IoT hub with event data and the necessary permission to access the policy keys. The IoT hub must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.

## Create a KQL database and an eventstream

Follow these steps to create a KQL database and an eventstream in your workspace:

1. Navigate to **My workspace**, and under the **New** drop-down menu, select **Show all**.
