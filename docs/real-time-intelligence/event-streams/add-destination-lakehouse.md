# Add a lakehouse destination to an eventstream

This article shows you how to add a lakehouse as a destination to an eventstream in Microsoft Fabric event streams. For optimized streaming performance and real-time querying, consider streaming data to an Eventhouse with [add Eventhouse destination to an eventstream](add-destination-kql-database.md) and then enable [Eventhouse OneLake Availability](../event-house-onelake-availability.md).

[!INCLUDE [select-view](./includes/select-view.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's *schema enforcement* for writing data into a lakehouse destination table. All new writes to the table must be compatible with the target table's schema at write time, ensuring data quality.
> 
> When output is written to a new delta table, the table schema is created based on the first record. All records of the output data are projected onto the schema of the existing table.
> 
> If the incoming data has columns that aren't in the existing table schema, the extra columns aren't included in the data written to the table. Likewise, if the incoming data is missing columns that are in the existing table schema, the missing columns write to the table with the values set to null.
>
> If the schema of a Delta table and an incoming record have no intersection, it results in a schema conversion failure. However, this isn't the only scenario that can cause such a failure.
>
> **If the schema of incoming data changes (i.e., the new data record's schema does not align with the first record), certain columns or entire records may be lost when writing to the lakehouse**. Therefore, using a lakehouse to receive such streaming data, such as database CDC data, isn't recommended.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- Access to the workspace where your lakehouse is located with Contributor or higher permissions.

## Add a lakehouse as a destination

To add a lakehouse destination to a default or derived eventstream, follow these steps.

1. In **Edit mode** for your eventstream, select **Add destination** on the ribbon and select **Lakehouse** from the dropdown list.

1. Connect the lakehouse node to your stream node or operator.

1. On the **Lakehouse** configuration screen, complete the following information:

   1. Enter a **Destination name**.
   1. Select the **Workspace** that contains your lakehouse.
   1. Select an existing **Lakehouse** from the workspace you specified.
   1. Select an existing **Delta table**, or create a new one to receive data.
   1. Select the **Input data format** that is sent to your lakehouse. The supported data formats are JSON, Avro, and CSV.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-destination-lakehouse/lakehouse-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the top part of the Lakehouse configuration screen.":::

1. Select **Advanced**.

1. Two ingestion modes are available for a lakehouse destination. Based on your scenario, configure these modes to optimize how Fabric event streams writes to the lakehouse.

   - **Minimum rows** is the minimum number of rows that the lakehouse ingests in a single file. The minimum is 1 row, and the maximum is 2 million rows per file. The smaller the minimum number of rows, the more files the lakehouse creates during ingestion.

   - **Maximum duration** is the maximum duration that the lakehouse takes to ingest a single file. The minimum is 1 minute and maximum is 2 hours. The longer the duration, the more rows are ingested in a file.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/add-destination-lakehouse/advanced-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Advanced section of the Lakehouse configuration screen.":::

1. Select **Save**.

1. To implement the newly added lakehouse destination, select **Publish**.

Once you complete these steps, the lakehouse destination is available for visualization in **Live view**. In the **Details** pane, you can select the **Optimize table in notebook** shortcut to launch an Apache Spark job within a Notebook, which consolidates the small streaming files within the target lakehouse table.

> [!NOTE]  
> When configuring an Eventstream, the source, transformation logic, and destination are typically added together. By default, when publishing the Eventstream, the backend services for both data ingestion and data routing start with **Now** respectively. However, data ingestion may begin faster than data routing, causing some data to be ingested into Eventstream before routing is fully initialized. As a result, this data may not be routed to the destination.  
>  
>  
> To mitigate this, follow these steps:  
> 1. When configuring an **Eventhouse (Event processing before ingestion)** or **Lakehouse** destination, uncheck **Activate ingestion** after adding the data source.

> 1. Manually activate ingestion after the Eventstream is published.  
> 1.  Use the **Custom time** option to select an earlier timestamp, ensuring initial data is properly processed and routed.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- Get access to a workspace with Contributor or above permissions where your lakehouse is located.

## Add a lakehouse as a destination

If you have a lakehouse created in your workspace, follow these steps to add the lakehouse to your eventstream as a destination:

1. Select **New destination** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then select **Lakehouse**. The **Lakehouse** destination configuration screen appears.

1. Enter a name for the eventstream destination and complete the information about your lakehouse.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-destination/eventstream-destinations-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Lakehouse destination configuration screen."lightbox="./media/event-streams-destination/eventstream-destinations-lakehouse.png":::

   1. **Lakehouse**: Select an existing lakehouse from the workspace you specified.
   1. **Delta table**: Select an existing delta table or create a new one to receive data.

      > [!NOTE]
      > When writing data into the lakehouse table, there's **Schema enforcement**. This means all new writes to a table must be compatible with the target table's schema at write time, ensuring data quality.
      >
      > All records of the output data are projected onto the schema of the existing table. When writing the output to a new delta table, the table schema is created based on the first record. If the incoming data has an additional column compared to the existing table schema, it writes to the table without including the extra column. Conversely, if the incoming data is missing a column compared to the existing table schema, it writes to the table with the column's value set to null.
   1. **Input data format**: Select the format for the data (input data) that is sent to your lakehouse.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The supported input event data formats are JSON, Avro, and CSV (with header).
   1. **Event processing**: You can use the event processing editor to specify how the data should be processed before sending it to your lakehouse. Select **Open event processor** to open the event processing editor. To learn more about real-time processing using the event processor, see [Process event data with event processor editor](./process-events-using-event-processor-editor.md). When you're done with the editor, select **Done** to return to the **Lakehouse** destination configuration screen.

1. Two ingestion modes are available for a lakehouse destination. Select one of these modes to optimize how the Fabric event streams feature writes to the lakehouse based on your scenario.
    1. **Rows per file** – The minimum number of rows that Lakehouse ingests in a single file. The smaller the minimum number of rows, the more files Lakehouse creates during ingestion. Minimum is 1 row. Maximum is 2M rows per file.
    1. **Duration** – The maximum duration that Lakehouse would take to ingest a single file. The longer the duration, more rows are ingested in a file. Minimum is 1 minute and maximum is 2 hours.

## Manage a destination

**Edit/remove**: You can edit or remove an eventstream destination either through the navigation pane or canvas.

When you select **Edit**, the edit pane opens in the right side of the main editor. You can modify the configuration as you wish, including the event transformation logic through the event processor editor.
