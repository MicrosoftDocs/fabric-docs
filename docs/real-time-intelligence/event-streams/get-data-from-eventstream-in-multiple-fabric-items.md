# Get data from Eventstream in multiple Fabric items

Event streams can route the event data to various destinations, including the Fabric items, for example: Fabric Lakehouse, Fabric KQL Database, etc. With the integration between Fabric Eventstream and these Fabric items, you can get the data from Eventstream item inside these Fabric items. This article describes how to use this integration experience within these Fabric items.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your Eventstream item is located.
- For a KQL database or Lakehouse item, get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your KQL database or Lakehouse item is located.

## Get data from Eventstream in a KQL database

To get data from Eventstream into a KQL table inside a KQL database, Select **Get data** on the ribbon of your KQL database

There are two options available:
- **Existing Eventstream**
- **New Eventstream**

### Get data from an existing eventstream

1. Select **Existing Eventstream** in the drop-down list, a wizard pops up:

1. To get all the steps completed, following this article [Get data wizard configuration guide](./../get-data-eventstream.md).

### Get data from a new eventstream

1. Select **New Eventstream** in the drop-down list, a dialog pops up asking for a new eventstream name:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-data-from-eventstream-in-multiple-fabric-items/get-data-to-kql-database-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new eventstream dialog." lightbox="./media/get-data-from-eventstream-in-multiple-fabric-items/get-data-to-kql-database-new.png" :::

1. After you select **Create** with the new eventstream name, the new eventstream will be open with the teaching bubbles.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/get-data-from-eventstream-in-multiple-fabric-items/get-data-to-kql-database-wizard-new-guide.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new eventstream naming dialog." lightbox="./media/get-data-from-eventstream-in-multiple-fabric-items/get-data-to-kql-database-wizard-new-guide.png" :::
