On the **Configure connection settings** page, follow these steps:

1. For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription that has the Event Grid namespace.

1. For **Namespace name**, select your Event Grid namespace from the dropdown list.

1. The contents of **Namespace topic** section vary depending on whether MQTT is enabled:

    - If MQTT isn't enabled for the namespace topic, create a new topic or select an existing topic.

    - If the namespace has MQTT enabled, a topic, and routing enabled, select the subscription and the namespace name.

    - If the namespace has MQTT enabled but routing isn't enabled for the namespace, select the subscription, the namespace name, and namespace topic options.

1. If you're using the real-time hub, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Stream details** section to the right, select the Fabric workspace where you want to save the eventstream.
    1. For **Eventstream name**, enter a name for the eventstream. The wizard creates an eventstream with the selected Event Grid namespace as a source.
    1. The **Stream name** value is automatically generated for you by appending **-stream** to the name of the eventstream. You can see this stream on the real-time hub's **All data streams** page when the wizard finishes.

1. If you're using the eventstream editor to add an Event Grid namespace as a source to an eventstream, select the pencil button under **Source name**. Then enter a source name.

1. Select **Next** at the bottom of the page.

1. On the **Review + connect** page, review your settings and then select **Connect**.
