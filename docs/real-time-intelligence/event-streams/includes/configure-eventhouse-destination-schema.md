1. Select **Transform events or add destination**, and then select **Eventhouse**.

    1. For **Input schema**, select one or more schemas from the dropdown list.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you selected the **Dynamic schema via headers** option when configuring an Event Hubs source, you might have configured multiple schemas for the source and mapped them to various properties and their values.

    1. For **Table creation method**, select **A single table with all schemas combined** or **Separate tables for each schema**, depending on your requirements.

    1. For **Write data with**, select one of the following options:

        - **Payload only**: Write extracted payload data to the table. If there are multiple input schemas, data is sent to multiple tables.
        - **Metadata and payload**: Write metadata and payload data to a single table. Example columns include `source` , `subject`, `type`, and `data`.
