| [Custom endpoint (that is, Custom App in standard capability)](../add-source-custom-app.md) | The custom endpoint feature allows your applications or Kafka clients to connect to Eventstream using a connection string, enabling the smooth ingestion of streaming data into Eventstream. |
| [Azure IoT Operations](/azure/iot-operations/connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-fabric-real-time-intelligence) | Configure Azure IoT Operations to send real-time data directly to Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence using an eventstream custom endpoint (supports Microsoft Entra ID or SASL authentication).  |
| [Sample data](../add-source-sample-data.md) | You can choose **Bicycles**, **Yellow Taxi**, **Stock Market**, **Buses**, **S&P 500 companies stocks** or **Semantic Model Logs** as a sample data source to test the data ingestion while setting up an eventstream. |
| [Real-time weather (preview)](../add-source-real-time-weather.md) | You can add a real-time weather source to an eventstream to stream real-time weather data from different locations. |
| [Azure SQL Database Change Data Capture (CDC)](../add-source-azure-sql-database-change-data-capture.md) | The Azure SQL Database CDC source connector allows you to capture a snapshot of the current data in an Azure SQL database. The connector then monitors and records any future row-level changes to this data. |
| [PostgreSQL Database CDC](../add-source-postgresql-database-change-data-capture.md) | The PostgreSQL Database Change Data Capture (CDC) source connector allows you to capture a snapshot of the current data in a PostgreSQL database. The connector then monitors and records any future row-level changes to this data. |
| [MySQL Database CDC](../add-source-mysql-database-change-data-capture.md) | The Azure MySQL Database Change Data Capture (CDC) Source connector allows you to capture a snapshot of the current data in an Azure Database for MySQL database. You can specify the tables to monitor, and the eventstream records any future row-level changes to the tables. |
| [Azure Cosmos DB CDC](../add-source-azure-cosmos-db-change-data-capture.md) | The Azure Cosmos DB Change Data Capture (CDC) source connector for Microsoft Fabric event streams lets you capture a snapshot of the current data in an Azure Cosmos DB database. The connector then monitors and records any future row-level changes to this data. |
| [SQL Server on virtual machine (VM) Database (DB) CDC](../add-source-sql-server-change-data-capture.md) | The SQL Server on VM DB (CDC) source connector for Fabric event streams allows you to capture a snapshot of the current data in a SQL Server database on VM. The connector then monitors and records any future row-level changes to the data. |
| [Azure SQL Managed Instance CDC](../add-source-azure-sql-managed-instance-change-data-capture.md) | The Azure SQL Managed Instance CDC source connector for Microsoft Fabric event streams allows you to capture a snapshot of the current data in a SQL Managed Instance database. The connector then monitors and records any future row-level changes to this data.  |
| [Fabric Workspace Item events](../add-source-fabric-workspace.md) | Fabric Workspace Item events are discrete Fabric events that occur when changes are made to your Fabric Workspace. These changes include creating, updating, or deleting a Fabric item. With Fabric event streams, you can capture these Fabric workspace events, transform them, and route them to various destinations in Fabric for further analysis. |
| [Fabric OneLake events](../add-source-fabric-onelake.md) | OneLake events allow you to subscribe to changes in files and folders in OneLake, and then react to those changes in real-time. With Fabric event streams, you can capture these OneLake events, transform them, and route them to various destinations in Fabric for further analysis. This seamless integration of OneLake events within Fabric event streams gives you greater flexibility for monitoring and analyzing activities in your OneLake. |
| [Fabric Job events](../add-source-fabric-job.md) | Job events allow you to subscribe to changes produced when Fabric runs a job. For example, you can react to changes when refreshing a semantic model, running a scheduled pipeline, or running a notebook. Each of these activities can generate a corresponding job, which in turn generates a set of corresponding job events. With Fabric event streams, you can capture these Job events, transform them, and route them to various destinations in Fabric for further analysis. This seamless integration of Job events within Fabric event streams gives you greater flexibility for monitoring and analyzing activities in your Job. |
| [Azure Blob Storage events](../add-source-azure-blob-storage.md) | Azure Blob Storage events are triggered when a client creates, replaces, or deletes a blob. The connector allows you to link Blob Storage events to Fabric events in Real-Time hub. You can convert these events into continuous data streams and transform them before routing them to various destinations in Fabric.|
| [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](../add-source-google-cloud-pub-sub.md) | Google Pub/Sub is a messaging service that enables you to publish and subscribe to streams of events. You can add Google Pub/Sub as a source to your eventstream to capture, transform, and route real-time events to various destinations in Fabric. | 
| [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](../add-source-amazon-kinesis-data-streams.md) | Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a massively scalable, highly durable data ingestion, and processing service optimized for streaming data.
