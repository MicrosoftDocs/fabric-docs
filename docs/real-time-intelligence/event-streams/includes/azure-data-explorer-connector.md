1. Now, on **Configure connection settings** page, follow these steps if you didn't specify the database and tables in the connection settings earlier. 
    1. For **Database**, enter the name of your database. 
    1. Then, in the **Enter table name(s)** field, enter either a single table name or multiple table names separated by commas.

1. If you're using **Real-Time hub**, follow these steps. Otherwise, move to the next step.
    1. In the **Stream details** section to the right, select the Fabric **workspace** where you want to save the eventstream that the Wizard is going to create.
    1. For **eventstream name**, enter a name for the eventstream. The wizard creates an eventstream with the selected Azure Database Explorer table as a source.
    1. The **Stream name** is automatically generated for you by appending **-stream** to the name of the eventstream. You can see this stream on the Real-time hub **All data streams** page when the wizard finishes.
