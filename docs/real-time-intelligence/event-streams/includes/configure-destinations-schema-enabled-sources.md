## Configure eventstream destinations to use schemas

Currently, only the eventhouse, custom endpoint, and derived stream destinations are supported for eventstreams with extended features enabled. This section shows you how to add and configure an eventhouse destination when extended features (like schema support) are enabled for the eventstream.

### Configure a schema for a custom endpoint destination

1. Select **Transform events or add destination**, and then select **CustomEndpoint**.

1. On the **Custom endpoint** pane, specify a name for the destination.

1. For **Input schema**, select the schema for events. You make a selection in this box when you enable schema support for an eventstream.

For detailed steps on configuring a custom endpoint destination, see [Add a custom endpoint or custom app destination to an eventstream](../add-destination-custom-app.md).
