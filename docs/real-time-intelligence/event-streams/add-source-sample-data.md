# Add a sample data source to an eventstream

To get a better understanding of how an eventstream works, you can use the out-of-box sample data provided and send the data to the eventstream. This article shows you how to add the sample data source to an eventstream. 

[!INCLUDE [select-view](./includes/select-view.md)]

::: zone pivot="enhanced-capabilities"  


## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- If you don't have an eventstream, [create an eventstream](create-manage-an-eventstream.md). 


## Add sample data as a source

Follow these steps to add a sample data source:

1. To add sample data source, on the get-started page, select **Use sample data**.

   Or, if you already have a published eventstream and want to add sample data as a source, switch to **Edit** mode. Then select **Add source** in the ribbon, and select **Sample data**.

1. On the **TridentStreaming_SampleData** screen, enter a **Source name**, select the source data you want under **Sample data**, and then select **Add**.

   - **Bicycles**: Sample bicycles data with a preset schema that includes fields such as BikepointID, Street, Neighborhood, and Latitude.
   - **Yellow Taxi**: Sample taxi data with a preset schema that includes fields such as pickup time, drop-off time, distance, and total fee.
   - **Stock Market**: Sample data of a stock exchange with preset schema columns such as time, symbol, price, and volume.
   - **Buses**: Sample buses data with a preset schema that includes fields such as Timestamp, TripId, StationNumber, SchedulTime and Properties.
   - **S&P 500 companies stocks**: Sample data of S&P 500 companies' historical stock prices with a preset schema that includes fields such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, Volume and Ticker.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media\add-source-sample-data-enhanced\sample-sources.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the choices on the Sample data screen.":::
1. After you create the sample data source, you see it added to your eventstream on the canvas in **Edit mode**. To implement this newly added sample data, select **Publish**.

    :::image type="content" source="media\add-source-sample-data-enhanced\edit-mode.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the eventstream in Edit mode, with the Publish button highlighted.":::
1. Once publishing succeeds, the sample data is available for visualization in **Live view**.
