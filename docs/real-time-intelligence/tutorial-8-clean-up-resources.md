# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 8: Clean up resources

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Tutorial part 7: Set an alert on your eventstream](tutorial-7-set-alert.md).

## Clean up resources

Once you finish the tutorial, you might want to delete all resources you created. You can delete the eventstream, eventhouse, KQL queryset, Real-Time dashboard, Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](includes/fabric-activator.md)], and Power BI report items individually, or you can delete the entire workspace.

1. Browse to the workspace in which you created the tutorial.
1. From the menu ribbon, select **Workspace settings**.
1. In the **General** settings pane, scroll down to the **Delete workspace** section.
1. Select **Remove this workspace**.
1. On the warning dialog that open, select **Delete**. Once a workspace is deleted, it can't be recovered.
