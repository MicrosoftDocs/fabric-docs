# Trigger Fabric items

Fabric Data Pipelines and Notebooks can be used to load or transform data in Microsoft Fabric. Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rules can take an action that starts jobs on Fabric items, which can be used in the following scenarios:

* Run Data Pipelines when new files are loaded to Azure storage accounts, to load files into OneLake. You can learn more about [Azure Storage events](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview).

* Run Fabric Notebooks when issues with data quality are found using Power BI reports. You can learn more about [getting data from Power BI](activator-get-data-power-bi.md).

## How to trigger a job on Fabric items

Start by selecting an existing Activator rule or [creating a rule](activator-create-activators.md).

In the rule definition pane on the right side of the screen, find **Action** section to define the action when chosen condition is met. Select **Fabric item** as the action type and select a specific item from the [OneLake Data Hub](../../governance/onelake-catalog-overview.md) pop-up window.

## Test, start, or stop an [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rule

Once you enter all of the required information, select **Save** to save the [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rule. To test the rule, select **Test action**. To start the rule, select **Start** from the top menu bar and to stop the rule, select **Stop.** **Stop** only appears while a rule is active.

## Pass parameter values to Fabric items (Preview)

You can now pass values to the parameters defined in the activated Fabric item. To pass parameter values in Activator portal, select **Edit action**, enter the parameter name and type exactly as how they are defined in the Fabric item. The parameter values can be entered manually or by selecting dynamic properties from the data source.

### Pass parameter values via rules created outside of Activator portal

If you are setting up an Activator rule from one of the embedded experiences such as Power BI, Real-Time Hub, or Data Pipeline, you can create the rule first. After the rule is created, you can click **Open** Activator to edit the parameter values:

* **[Set up the rule from data pipeline](/fabric/data-factory/pipeline-storage-event-triggers)**
* **Set up the rule from Real-Time hub**: To set a rule from an Azure event (as an example) in Real-Time hub, select **Azure events** on the left navigation menu, and then select **Set alert**.

### Types of parameters

Activator enables passing parameters in string, boolean, and number (float). Follow the guidelines to pass number and boolean:

**Number**

| Input Value | Result | Valid value? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `123.45` | 123.45 | Yes | Dot as decimal separator |	
| `1,234.56` | 1234.56 | Yes | Comma as thousands separator |	
| `0.99` | 0.99 | Yes |  |	
| `1e3` | 1000 | Yes | Scientific notation |	
| `123,45` | 0 | No | Invalid in en-US (comma not decimal) |	
| null or whitespace | 0 | No |  |	
| any other string | 0 | No |  |	
			
**Boolean**

| Input Value | Result | Valid value? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `true` | true | Yes | Case-insensitive |	
| `1` | true | Yes |  |	
| `yes` | true | Yes |  |	
| `y` | true | Yes |  |	
| `false` | false | Yes | Case-insensitive |	
| `0` | false | Yes |  |	
| `no` | false | Yes |  |	
| `n` | false | Yes |  |	
| null or whitespace | false | No |  |	
| any other string | false | No |  |	



> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the parameter name and type are defined exactly the same as defined the activated Fabric item. If you have any feedback or ideas regarding this feature, share it on [Activator community](https://aka.ms/ActivatorCommunity).
