# Trigger Fabric items

Fabric Pipelines, Notebooks, Spark Job Definition, User Data Function (preview) can be used to load, transform, and analyze data in Microsoft Fabric. Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rules can take an action that starts jobs on Fabric items, which can be used in the following scenarios:

* Run Pipelines when new files are loaded to Azure storage accounts, to load files into OneLake. You can learn more about [Azure Storage events](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview).

* Run Notebooks when issues with data quality are found using Power BI reports. You can learn more about [getting data from Power BI](activator-get-data-power-bi.md).

* Run Spark Jobs to submit batch or streaming tasks to Spark clusters

* Run Functions to execute custom business logic to analyze and process data with code

## How to trigger a job on Fabric items

Start by selecting an existing Activator rule or [creating a rule](activator-create-activators.md).

In the rule definition pane on the right side of the screen, find **Action** section to define the action when chosen condition is met. Select an action type and select a specific Fabric item from the [OneLake Data Hub](../../governance/onelake-catalog-overview.md) pop-up window.

## Test, start, or stop an [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rule

Once you enter all of the required information, select **Save** to save the [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rule. To test the rule, select **Test action**. To start the rule, select **Start** from the top menu bar and to stop the rule, select **Stop.** **Stop** only appears while a rule is active.

## Pass parameter values to Fabric items (Preview)

You can now pass values to the parameters defined in the activated Fabric item. To pass parameter values in Activator portal, select **Edit action**, enter the parameter name and type exactly as how they are defined in the Fabric item. The parameter values can be entered manually or by selecting dynamic properties from the data source.

For Spark Job Definition, Activator support passing parameter values to [command line arguments, executable main file, and main class](https://aka.ms/sparkjobdefinitionparameters). 

### Types of parameters

Activator enables passing parameters in string, boolean, and number (float). For User Data Function, Activator support all parameter types supported by functions. Follow the guidelines to pass number and boolean:

**Number**

| Input Value | Result | Valid value? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `123.45` | 123.45 | Yes | Dot as decimal separator |	
| `1,234.56` | 1234.56 | Yes | Comma as thousands separator |	
| `0.99` | 0.99 | Yes |  |	
| `1e3` | 1000 | Yes | Scientific notation |	
| `123,45` | 0 | No | Invalid in en-US (comma not decimal) |	
| null or whitespace | 0 | No |  |	
| any other string | 0 | No |  |	

**Boolean**

| Input Value | Result | Valid value? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `true` | true | Yes | Case-insensitive |	
| `1` | true | Yes |  |	
| `yes` | true | Yes |  |	
| `y` | true | Yes |  |	
| `false` | false | Yes | Case-insensitive |	
| `0` | false | Yes |  |	
| `no` | false | Yes |  |	
| `n` | false | Yes |  |	
| null or whitespace | false | No |  |	
| any other string | false | No |  |	



> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the parameter name and type are defined exactly the same as defined the activated Fabric item. If you have any feedback or ideas regarding this feature, share it on [Activator community](https://aka.ms/ActivatorCommunity).
