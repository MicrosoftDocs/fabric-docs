# [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] limitations

Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] is subject to the following general and specific limitations. Before you began your work with [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)], review and consider these limitations.
[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] is subject to the following general and specific limitations.

## General limitations

* Creating alerts for a report using Dynamic M parameters isn't supported.
* Creating alerts from the Fabric or Power BI Capacity Metrics app isn't supported.

## Activator item migration from Preview to GA

Activator became Generally Available (GA) in November 2024. The move to GA impacts the functionality of your Activator items and rules. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to take action or your Activator items created during the preview will be deleted in March 2025.

If you created a rule or activator while Activator was in preview, those rules and activators will eventually be deleted. The rules and activators created during preview are being phased out according to the following schedule.

- January 2025, the items convert to read-only mode. Rules currently running continue to run but can't be edited. Recreate these rules in a new Activator item to keep them running and editable.
- March 2025, all Activator items are deleted. Even running rules are deleted.

To ensure no gaps in functionality, create new activator items and recreate your rules.

### How to check if your item needs to be migrated

If the item shows Data and Design mode tabs in the lower left corner of the item, it needs to be migrated. If the Data and Design tabs are visible, [recreate your rules in a new item](activator-create-activators.md) to get all the newest capabilities.

* Stacked column
* Clustered column
* Stacked bar
* Stacked 100% column
* Stacked 100% bar
* Clustered bar
* Ribbon chart
* Line

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] also supports the following map visuals. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] only supports map visuals that use the *Location* field to specify the location of objects on the map. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] doesn't support visuals that use *Latitude* and *Longitude* fields.

* Bing Map
* Filled Map
* Azure Map
* ArcGIS map

## Supported Real-Time Dashboard tiles

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] supports the following tile types in Real-Time Dashboards:

* Time chart
* Bar chart
* Column chart
* Area chart
* Line chart
* Stat
* Multi stat
* Pie Chart

Additionally, for [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] to support a tile:

* The data in the tile must not be static.
* The data in the tile must be based on a KQL query.
* The tile must have at most one time range.
* The tile must be filtered by a predefined time range. Using a custom time range isn't supported.
* The tile must not contain time series data (for example, data created using the *make-series* KQL operator)

For more information, see [Limitations on charts with a time axis](activator-get-data-real-time-dashboard.md#limitations-on-charts-with-a-time-axis).

## Allowed recipients of email notifications

Each recipient of an email notification must have an internal email address. The recipient must belong to the same domain as the creator or other verified domains on creator's Microsoft Entra tenant. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] doesn't allow email notifications to be sent to either external email addresses or guest email addresses.

To check if the recipient's domain is one of the verified domains, visit [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for **Microsoft Entra ID**. Once landed in Microsoft Entra ID, select **Custom domain names** in the left panel and check if recipient's domain is listed there.

## Allowed chats and channel for Teams notifications

For Teams group chats, only recently active chats are enabled for selection. If the chat you are looking for isn't displayed in Activator, send a message to the chat to ensure it's recently active. Additionally, for Teams channels, only shared channels are displayed and available. Sending messages to [private channels](https://aka.ms/TeamsPrivateChannel) isn't enabled.

## Maximum data for rule processing limits

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] has a limit on the number of events that are processed in a rule based on the type of data being used in the rule. If your rule exceeds the maximum, [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] stops your rule. For eventstreams, the maximum is 1,000 events per second.

## Maximum number of actions

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] imposes the following limits on the number of actions that might occur in a given time period. If an action exceeds the limit, [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] might throttle or cancel the action.

|Rule action  |Scope  |Limit  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Email     |Messages/activator item/hour         |500        |
|Email     |Messages/rule/recipient/hour   |30         |
|Teams     |Messages/activator item/hour         |500        |
|Teams     |Messages/rule/recipient/hour   |30         |
|Teams     |Messages/recipient/hour           |100        |
|Teams     |Messages/Teams tenant/second      |50         |
|custom action |Power Automate flow executions/rule/hour      |10000      |
|Fabric item |Activations/user/minute| 50   |

## Maximum number of [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] items

Your organization might have up to 500 [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] items per region. If you try to create more than this number of items, you receive an error message. To resolve the error, either:

* Use an existing [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] item instead of creating a new item, or
* Delete some of your existing [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] items.

* Eventstream Â (rolling out)
* Real Time Hub Fabric Events (rolling out)
