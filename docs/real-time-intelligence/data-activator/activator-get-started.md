# Get started with [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)]

There are several different ways to create a Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] activator. This article teaches you how to create an activator from the left navigation bar (navbar).

## Create an Activator item

In Microsoft Fabric, select **[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)]** from the workload switcher in the bottom left corner.

As with all Fabric workloads, you can begin using [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] by creating an item in a Fabric workspace. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)]’s items are called *activators.*

An activator holds all the information necessary to connect to data, monitor for conditions, and act. You typically create an activator for each business process or area you monitor.

1. Select a workplace to make it active.
1. From the left navbar, select **Create**.
1. From the **New** menu in the workspace, choose **Activator**.

1. From here, you can start adding data to your activator or you can use our **Package delivery sample** to get familiar with [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)]. The [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] tutorial](activator-tutorial.md) uses the sample to teach you how to create and use rules on objects in your live data.

Once you create an activator, populate it with data. Learn how to get data into your activator from these two articles:

- [Get data for [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] from Power BI](activator-get-data-power-bi.md)
- [Get data for [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] from eventstreams](activator-get-data-eventstreams.md)

Alternatively, if you just want to learn how to use [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] using sample data, try the [[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] tutorial using sample data](activator-tutorial.md).
