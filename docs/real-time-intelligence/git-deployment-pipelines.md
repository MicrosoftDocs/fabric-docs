# Git integration and deployment pipelines

Real-Time Intelligence integrates with the [lifecycle management capabilities](../cicd/cicd-overview.md) in Microsoft Fabric, providing standardized collaboration between all development team members throughout the product's life. 

Fabric platform offers Git integration and Deployment pipelines for different scenarios:

* Use [Git integration](../cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration.md) to sync a workspace to a git repo, and manage incremental change, team collaboration, commit history.
* Use [Deployment pipelines](../cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines.md) to deploy a workspace to different development, test, and production environments.

## Git integration

Real-Time Intelligence supports git integration for Eventstreams, Eventhouses, KQL databases, KQL querysets, Real-Time dashboards, and Activator. The git integration allows you to track changes to these items in a git-connected workspace. The integration provides a way to manage the lifecycle of these items, including versioning, branching, and merging.

For details on setting up Git integration, see [Get started with Git integration](../cicd/git-integration/git-get-started.md).

### Supported items 

- [Eventstream](git-eventstream.md)
- [Eventhouse and KQL database](git-eventhouse-kql-database.md)
- [KQL querysets](git-kql-queryset.md)
- [Real-Time dashboards](git-real-time-dashboard.md)
- [Activator](git-activator.md)

## Deployment Pipelines

Real-Time Intelligence supports deployment pipelines for Eventstreams, Eventhouses, KQL databases, KQL querysets, Real-Time dashboards, and Activator. Microsoft Fabric's deployment pipelines tool provides content creators with a production environment where they can collaborate with others to manage the lifecycle of organizational content. Deployment pipelines enable creators to develop and test content in the service before it reaches the users.

For details on setting up deployment pipelines, see [Get started with deployment pipelines](../cicd/deployment-pipelines/get-started-with-deployment-pipelines.md).

## Limitation

* **Git Integration** and **Deployment Pipeline** have limited support for cross-workspace scenarios. To avoid issues, make sure all Eventstream destinations within the same workspace. Cross-workspace deployment might not work as expected.
* If an Eventstream includes an Eventhouse destination using **Direct Ingestion** mode, youâ€™ll need to manually reconfigure the connection after importing or deploying it to a new workspace.
