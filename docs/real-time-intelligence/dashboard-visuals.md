# Real-Time Dashboard-specific visuals (preview)

All visualizations that are created in the context of the [render operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/render-operator?context=/fabric/context/context-rta&pivots=fabric) are available in dashboard visualizations. However, the following visualizations are only available in Real-Time Dashboards, and not with the render operator.

To learn how to customize any dashboard visuals, see [Customize Azure Data Explorer dashboard visuals](dashboard-visuals-customize.md)

For general information on Real-Time Dashboards, see [Visualize data with Real-Time Dashboards](dashboard-real-time-create.md).
