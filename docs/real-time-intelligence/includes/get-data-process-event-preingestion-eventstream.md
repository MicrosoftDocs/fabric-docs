### Process event before ingestion in Eventstream

The **Process event before ingestion in Eventstream** option enables you to process the data before it's ingested into the destination table. With this option, the get data process seamlessly continues in Eventstream, with the destination table and data source details automatically populated.

To process event before ingestion in Eventstream:

1. On the **Configure** tab, select **Process event before ingestion in Eventstream**.

1. In the **Process events in Eventstream** dialog box, select **Continue in Eventstream**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Selecting **Continue in Eventstream** ends the get data process in Real-Time Intelligence and continues in Eventstream with the destination table and data source details automatically populated.
