# Eventhouse monitoring

Eventhouse monitoring in Fabric offers comprehensive insights into the usage and performance of your eventhouse by collecting end-to-end metrics and logs for all aspects of an Eventhouse. It's part of [workspace monitoring](../fundamentals/workspace-monitoring-overview.md) that allows you to monitor Fabric items in your workspace. Eventhouse monitoring provides a set of tables that you can query to get insights into the usage and performance of your eventhouse. Use these queries to optimize your eventhouse and improve the user experience.

## Eventhouse monitoring tables

When monitoring your eventhouse, you can query the following tables:

* [Metrics](monitor-metrics.md)

* [Command logs](monitor-logs-command.md)
* [Data operation logs](monitor-logs-data-operation.md)
* [Ingestion results logs](monitor-logs-ingestion-results.md)
* [Query logs](monitor-logs-query.md)

## Sample queries

You can find sample queries in the [workspace-monitoring](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/tree/main/workspace-monitoring) folder of the *fabric-samples* GitHub repository.

## Eventhouse monitoring templates

The templates allow you to create monitoring dashboards that track workspace activities in real-time by connecting directly to the underlying monitoring Eventhouse. In the dashboard, you can monitor semantic models, KQL database queries, and ingestions.

Download the templates from the [workspace-monitoring-dashboards](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-toolbox/tree/main/monitoring/workspace-monitoring-dashboards) GitHub repository or from the links below. 

The repository contains instructions on how to prepare the environment and how to use the templates.

There are two monitoring templates available:

* [Real-Time Dashboard template](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-toolbox/blob/main/monitoring/workspace-monitoring-dashboards/Fabric%20Workspace%20Monitoring%20Dashboard.json)
