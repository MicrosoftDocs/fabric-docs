# Get data from Real-Time hub (preview)

In this article, you learn how to get events from Real-Time hub into either a new or existing table.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Currently Real-Time hub only supports eventstreams as a source.
> Real-Time hub is currently in preview.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A [KQL database](create-database.md) with editing permissions
* An [eventstream](event-streams/create-manage-an-eventstream.md) with a data source

## Source

To get data from Real-Time hub, you need to select a Real-time stream from Real-time data hub as your data source. You can select Real-Time hub in the following ways:

On the lower ribbon of your KQL database, either:

* From the **Get Data** dropdown menu, then under **Continuous**, select **Real-Time hub (preview)**.

* Select **Get Data** and then in the **Get data** window, select a stream from the Real-Time hub section.

    [!INCLUDE [get-data-kql](includes/get-data-kql.md)]

* Select a data stream from the Real-Time hub stream list.

## Configure

1. Select a target table. If you want to ingest data into a new table, select **+ New table** and enter a table name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Table names can be up to 1024 characters including spaces, alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores. Special characters aren't supported.
1. Under **Configure the data source**, fill out the settings using the information in the following table. Some setting information automatically fills from your eventstream.

    |**Setting** | **Description**|
    |----|----|
    | Workspace| Your eventstream workspace location. Your workspace name is automatically filled. |
    | Eventstream Name| The name of your eventstream. Your eventstream name is automatically filled.|
    | Data connection name| The name used to reference and manage your data connection in your workspace. The data connection name is automatically filled. Optionally, you can enter a new name. The name can only contain alphanumeric, dash, and dot characters, and be up to 40 characters in length.|
    | Process event before ingestion in Eventstream | This option allows you to configure data processing before data is ingested into the destination table. If selected, you continue the data ingestion process in Eventstream. For more information, see [Process event before ingestion in Eventstream](#process-event-before-ingestion-in-eventstream).|
    | **Advanced filters**| |
    | Compression| Data compression of the events, as coming from the hub. Options are None (default), or Gzip compression.|
    | Event system properties| If there are multiple records per event message, the system properties are added to the first one. For more information, see [Event system properties](get-data-event-hub.md#event-system-properties).|
    | Event retrieval start date| The data connection retrieves existing events created since the Event retrieval start date. It can only retrieve events retained by the hub, based on its retention period. The time zone is UTC. If no time is specified, the default time is the time at which the data connection is created.|

1. Select **Next**

[!INCLUDE [get-data-process-event-preingestion-eventstream](includes/get-data-process-event-preingestion-eventstream.md)]

## Inspect

The **Inspect** tab opens with a preview of the data.

To complete the ingestion process, select **Finish**.

Optionally:

* Select **Command viewer** to view and copy the automatic commands generated from your inputs.
* Change the automatically inferred data format by selecting the desired format from the dropdown. Data is read from the hub in the form of [EventData](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.eventdata?context=/fabric/context/context) objects. Supported formats are Avro, Apache Avro, CSV, JSON, ORC, Parquet, PSV, RAW, SCsv, SOHsv, TSV, TXT, and TSVE.
* [Edit columns](#edit-columns).
* Explore [Advanced options based on data type](#advanced-options-based-on-data-type).

## Summary

In the **Data preparation** window, all three steps are marked with green check marks when data ingestion finishes successfully. You can select a card to query, drop the ingested data, or see a dashboard of your ingestion summary. Select **Close** to close the window.
