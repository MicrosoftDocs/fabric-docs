# Migrate from Azure Synapse Data Explorer to Eventhouse - REST API (preview)

Migrates a source Azure Synapse Data Explorer cluster to Eventhouse. The process creates a new eventhouse and migrates all databases from the source cluster to the eventhouse. For more information, see [Migrate from Azure Synapse Data Explorer to Fabric Eventhouse](migrate-synapse-data-explorer.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Plan your migration carefully, as the process is irreversible and the source cluster can't be restored. Start by running the [validate migration](migrate-api-validate-synapse-data-explorer.md) API to ensure that the source cluster is suitable for migration.
> - After the migration, the source cluster is placed in a new state called *Migrated*. In this state, the cluster is suspended and can't be resumed or restored. As long as the source cluster exists, its endpoints are redirected to the eventhouse. The source cluster's endpoints remain active for up to 90 days following the migration. Once the source cluster is deleted, its endpoints stop redirecting to the eventhouse. We recommend that users update all queries and ingestion processes to the new eventhouse endpoints within this period.

```

## Examples

### Sample request

```http
POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/WorkspaceId/eventhouses

{
  "displayName": "NewEventhouse",
  "description": "Eventhouse migrated from Azure Synapse Data Explorer pool.",
  "creationPayload": {
    "migrationSourceClusterUrl": "https://{AzurePoolName}.{WorkspaceName}.kusto.azuresynapse.net"
