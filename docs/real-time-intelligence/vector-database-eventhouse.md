# Tutorial: Use an Eventhouse as a vector database

In this tutorial, you learn how to use an Eventhouse as a vector database to store and query vector data in Real-Time Intelligence. For general information about vector databases, see [Vector databases](vector-database.md)

The given scenario involves the use of semantic searches on Wikipedia pages to find pages with common themes. You use an available sample dataset, which includes vectors for tens of thousands of Wikipedia pages. These pages have already been embedded with an OpenAI model to produce vectors for each page. The vectors, along with some pertinent metadata related to the page, are then stored in an Eventhouse. You can use this dataset to find pages that are similar to each other, or to find pages that are similar to some theme you want to find. For example, say you want to look up "famous female scientists of the 19th century," you encode this phrase using the same OpenAI model, and then run a vector similarity search over the stored Wikipedia page data to find the pages with the highest semantic similarity.

Specifically, in this tutorial you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Prepare a table in the Eventhouse with `Vector16` encoding for the vector columns.
> * Store vector data from a pre-embedded dataset to an Eventhouse.
> * Embed afor a natural language query using the Open AI model.
> * Use the [series_cosine_similarity KQL function](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/series-cosine-similarity-function) to calculate the similarities between the query embedding vector and those of the wiki pages.
> * View rows of the highest similarity to get the wiki pages that are most relevant to your search query.

This flow can be visualized as follows:

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* An [eventhouse](create-eventhouse.md) in your workspace
* An Azure OpenAI resource with the text-embedding-ada-002 (Version 2) model deployed. This model is currently only available in certain regions. For more information, see [Create a resource](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).
    * Make sure that local authentication is [enabled](/azure/ai-services/disable-local-auth#re-enable-local-authentication) on your Azure OpenAI resource.
* Download the [sample notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/real-time-intelligence/vector-database-eventhouse-notebook.ipynb) from the GitHub repository

> [!NOTE]
> While this tutorial uses Azure OpenAI, you can use any embedding model provider to generate vectors for text data.

## Prepare your Eventhouse environment

In this setup step, you create a table in an Eventhouse with the necessary columns and encoding policies to store the vector data.

1. Browse to your workspace homepage in Real-Time Intelligence.
1. Select the Eventhouse you created in the prerequisites.
1. Select the target database where you want to store the vector data. If you don't have a database, you can create one by selecting **Add database**.
1. Select **Explore my data**. Copy/paste the following KQL query to create a table with the necessary columns:

    ```kusto
    .create table Wiki (id:string,url:string,['title']:string,text:string,title_vector:dynamic,content_vector:dynamic,vector_id:long)
    ```

1. Copy/paste the following commands to set the encoding policy of the vector columns. Run these commands sequentially.

    ```kusto
    .alter column Wiki.title_vector policy encoding type='Vector16'

    .alter column Wiki.content_vector policy encoding type='Vector16'
    ```

## Write vector data to an Eventhouse

The following steps are used to import the embedded Wikipedia data and write it in an Eventhouse:

### Import notebook

1. Download the sample notebook from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/real-time-intelligence/vector-database-eventhouse-notebook.ipynb).
1. Browse to your Fabric environment. In the experience switcher, choose **Data Engineering**.
1. Select **Import notebook** > **Upload**, and choose the upload you downloaded in a previous step. :::image type="icon" source="media/vector-database/import-notebook.png" border="false":::
1. Open the imported notebook item.

### Write data to the Eventhouse

1. Run the cells to set up your environment.

    ```python
    %%configure -f
    {"conf":
        {
            "spark.rpc.message.maxSize": "1024"
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ```python
    %pip install wget
    ```
    
    ```python
    %pip install openai
    ```
      
1. Run the cells to download the precomputed embeddings.

    ```python
    import wget
    
    embeddings_url = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip"
    
    # The file is ~700 MB so it might take some time
    wget.download(embeddings_url)
    ```
    
    ```python
    import zipfile
    
    with zipfile.ZipFile("vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip","r") as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall("/lakehouse/default/Files/data")
    ```
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    
    from ast import literal_eval
    
    article_df = pd.read_csv('/lakehouse/default/Files/data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv')
    # Read vectors from strings back into a list
    article_df["title_vector"] = article_df.title_vector.apply(literal_eval)
    article_df["content_vector"] = article_df.content_vector.apply(literal_eval)
    article_df.head()
    ```

1. To write to the eventhouse, enter your Cluster URI, which can be found on the [system overview page](manage-monitor-eventhouse.md#view-system-overview-details-for-an-eventhouse), and the name of the database. The table is created in the notebook and later referenced in the query.

    ```python
    # replace with your Eventhouse Cluster URI, Database name, and Table name
    KUSTO_CLUSTER =  "Eventhouse Cluster URI"
    KUSTO_DATABASE = "Database name"
    KUSTO_TABLE = "Wiki"
    ```

1. Run the remaining cells to write the data to the Eventhouse. This operation can take some time to execute.

    ```python
    kustoOptions = {"kustoCluster": KUSTO_CLUSTER, "kustoDatabase" :KUSTO_DATABASE, "kustoTable" : KUSTO_TABLE }
    
    access_token=mssparkutils.credentials.getToken(kustoOptions["kustoCluster"])
    ```

    ```python
    #Pandas data frame to spark dataframe
    sparkDF=spark.createDataFrame(article_df)
    ```

    ```python
    # Write data to a table in Eventhouse
    sparkDF.write. \
    format("com.microsoft.kusto.spark.synapse.datasource"). \
    option("kustoCluster",kustoOptions["kustoCluster"]). \
    option("kustoDatabase",kustoOptions["kustoDatabase"]). \
    option("kustoTable", kustoOptions["kustoTable"]). \
    option("accessToken", access_token). \
    option("tableCreateOptions", "CreateIfNotExist").\
    mode("Append"). \
    save()
    ```

### View the data in the Eventhouse

At this point, you can verify the data was written to the eventhouse by browsing to the database details page.

1. Browse to your workspace homepage in Real-Time Intelligence.
1. Select the database item that was provided in the previous section. You should see a summary of the data that was written to the "Wiki" table:

    :::image type="content" source="media/vector-database/database-with-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of database details page with data ingested from the embedded sample data.":::

## Generate embedding for the search term

Now that you stored the embedded wiki data in your eventhouse, you can use this data as a reference to find pages on a particular article. In order to make the comparison, you embed the search term, and then do a comparison between the search term and the Wikipedia pages.

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an endpoint, key, and deployment ID.

| Variable name | Value |
|---|---|
| endpoint |This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). Alternatively, you can find the value in the **[Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) > Playground > Code View**. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`. |
| API key |	This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). You can use either KEY1 or KEY2. |
| deployment ID | This value can be found under the **Deployments** section in the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/). |

Use the information in the table when running the Azure OpenAI cells.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Local authentication must be [enabled](/azure/ai-services/disable-local-auth#re-enable-local-authentication) on your Azure Open AI resource in order to use the API key.

```python
import openai
```

```python
openai.api_version = '2022-12-01'
openai.api_base = 'endpoint' # Add your endpoint here
openai.api_type = 'azure'
openai.api_key = 'api key'  # Add your api key here

def embed(query):
  # Creates embedding vector from user query
  embedded_query = openai.Embedding.create(
          input=query,
          deployment_id="deployment id", # Add your deployment id here
          chunk_size=1
  )["data"][0]["embedding"]
  return embedded_query
```

```python
searchedEmbedding = embed("most difficult gymnastics moves in the olympics")
#print(searchedEmbedding)
```

## Query the similarity

The query is run directly from the notebook, and uses the returned embedding from the previous step in a comparison against the embedded Wikipedia pages stored in your eventhouse. This query uses the [cosine similarity function](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/series-cosine-similarity-function) and returns the top 10 most similar vectors.

Run the cells in the notebook to see the results of the query. You can change the search term and rerun the query to see different results. You could also compare an existing entry in the Wiki database to find similar entries.

```python
kustoQuery = "Wiki | extend similarity = series_cosine_similarity(dynamic("+str(searchedEmbedding)+"), content_vector) | top 10 by similarity desc" 
accessToken = mssparkutils.credentials.getToken(KUSTO_CLUSTER)
kustoDf  = spark.read\
    .format("com.microsoft.kusto.spark.synapse.datasource")\
    .option("accessToken", accessToken)\
    .option("kustoCluster", KUSTO_CLUSTER)\
    .option("kustoDatabase", KUSTO_DATABASE)\
    .option("kustoQuery", kustoQuery).load()

# Example that uses the result data frame.
kustoDf.show()
```
