# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 7: Clean up resources

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Tutorial part 6: Create a Power BI report from your KQL queryset](tutorial-6-power-bi-report.md)

## Clean up resources

Once you're finished with the tutorial, you might want to delete all resources you created. You can delete the event stream, eventhouse, KQL queryset, Real-Time dashboard, and Power BI report items individually, or you can delete the entire workspace.

1. Browse to the workspace in which you created the tutorial.
1. In the ribbon, select the **More menu** [**...**] > **Workspace settings**.
1. Select **Other** > **Delete this workspace**
1. On the warning, select **Delete**. Once a workspace is deleted, it can't be recovered.
