# Explore your data visually in Real-Time Dashboards

By visually drilling into data, you can identify trends, anomalies, and correlations that might not be immediately apparent. You can use dashboards to perform this exploration to gain a more nuanced understanding of the data and optimize your operations, improve their products and services, and gain a competitive advantage. In some cases, you are interacting with a dashboard and want to explore the data in more detail. The visual exploration feature in Real-Time dashboards allows you to interact with the data in a no-code experience, enabling you to aggregate, and filter the data to extract insights and identify actions to take.

This user flow shows how an insights explorer can use a Real-Time Dashboard to understand real world high granularity data, extract insights, visually drill into specific activities, and identify actions to take.
