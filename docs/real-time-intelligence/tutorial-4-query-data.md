# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 4: Query streaming data using KQL

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 3: Transform data in a KQL database](tutorial-3-transform-kql-database.md).

In this part of the tutorial, you learn how to query your streaming data using KQL. You write a KQL query and visualize the data in a time chart.

## Write a KQL query

The name of the table you created from the update policy in a previous step is *TransformedData*. Use this table name (case-sensitive) as the data source for your query.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a sufficient subscription, you can use the Copilot feature to help you write queries. Copilot provides queries based on data in your table and natural language prompts. For more information, see [Copilot for Real-Time Intelligence (preview)](../fundamentals/copilot-real-time-intelligence.md)

1. Enter the following query. Then press **Shift + Enter** to run the query.

    ```kusto
    TransformedData
    | where BikepointID > 100 and Neighbourhood == "Chelsea"
    | project Timestamp, No_Bikes
    | render timechart
    ```

    This query creates a time chart that shows the number of bikes in the Chelsea neighborhood as a time chart.

## Create a materialized view

In this step, you create a materialized view, which returns an up-to-date result of the aggregation query (always fresh). Querying a materialized view is more performant than running the aggregation directly over the source table.

1. Copy/paste and run the following command to create a materialized view that shows the most recent number of bikes at each bike station:

    ``` kusto
    .create-or-alter materialized-view with (folder="Gold") AggregatedData on table TransformedData
    {
       TransformedData
       | summarize arg_max(Timestamp,No_Bikes) by BikepointID
    }
    ```

1. Copy/paste and run the following query to see the data in the materialized view visualized as a column chart:

    ```kusto
    AggregatedData
    | sort by BikepointID
    | render columnchart with (ycolumns=No_Bikes,xcolumn=BikepointID)
    ```

You will use this query in the next step to create a Real-Time dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you missed any of the steps used to create the tables, update policy, function, or materialized views, use this script to create all required resources: [Tutorial commands script](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/real-time-intelligence/tutorial-commands-script.kql).
