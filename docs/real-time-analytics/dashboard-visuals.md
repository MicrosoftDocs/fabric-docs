# Dashboard-specific visuals

All visualizations that are created in the context of the [render operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/render-operator?context=/fabric/context/context-rta&pivots=fabric) are available in dashboard visualizations. However, the following visualizations are only available in Real-Time Dashboards, and not with the render operator.

To learn how to customize any dashboard visuals, see [Customize Azure Data Explorer dashboard visuals](customize-dashboard-visuals.md)

For general information on Real-Time Dashboards, see [Visualize data with Real-Time Dashboards](real-time-dashboard.md).
