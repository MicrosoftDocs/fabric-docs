# Set up and use private links

In Fabric, you can configure and use an endpoint that allows your organization to access Fabric privately. To configure private endpoints, you must be a Fabric administrator and have permissions in Azure to create and configure resources such as virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks (VNets).

The steps that allow you to securely access Fabric from private endpoints are:

1. [Set up private endpoints for Fabric](#step-1-set-up-private-endpoints-for-fabric).
2. [Create a Microsoft.PowerBI private link services for Power BI resource in the Azure portal](#step-2-create-a-microsoftpowerbi-private-link-services-for-power-bi-resource-in-the-azure-portal).
3. [Create a virtual network](#step-3-create-a-virtual-network).
4. [Create a virtual machine (VM)](#step-4-create-a-virtual-machine).
5. [Create a private endpoint](#step-5-create-a-private-endpoint).
6. [Connect to a VM using Bastion](#step-6-connect-to-a-vm-using-bastion).
7. [Access Fabric privately from the virtual machine](#step-7-access-fabric-privately-from-the-vm).
8. [Disable public access for Fabric](#step-8-disable-public-access-for-fabric).

The following sections provide additional information for each step.

### Step 1. Set up private endpoints for Fabric

1. Sign in to [Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com) as an administrator.
1. [Go to the tenant settings](../admin/about-tenant-settings.md#how-to-get-to-the-tenant-settings).
1. Find and expand the setting **Azure Private Link**.
1. Set the toggle to *Enabled*.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/security-private-links-use/enable-azure-private-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure Private Link tenant setting.":::

It takes about 15 minutes to configure a private link for your tenant. This includes configuring a separate FQDN (fully qualified domain name) for the tenant in order to communicate privately with Fabric services.

When this process is finished, move on to the next step.

### Step 2. Create a Microsoft.PowerBI private link services for Power BI resource in the Azure portal

This step is used to support Azure Private Endpoint association with your Fabric resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Create a resource**.
1. Under **Template deployment**, select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/security-private-links-use/azure-create-template-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create template link in the Create a resource section.":::

2. On the **Custom deployment** page, select **Build your own template in the editor**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/security-private-links-use/azure-create-template-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Build your own template option.":::

3. In the editor, create the following a Fabric resource using the ARM template as shown below, where

    * `<resource-name>` is the name you choose for the Fabric resource.
    * `<tenant-object-id>` is your Microsoft Entra tenant ID. See [How to find your Microsoft Entra tenant ID](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant).

    ```
    {
      "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {},
      "resources": [
          {
              "type":"Microsoft.PowerBI/privateLinkServicesForPowerBI",
              "apiVersion": "2020-06-01",
              "name" : "<resource-name>",
              "location": "global",
              "properties" : 
              {
                   "tenantId": "<tenant-object-id>"
              }
          }
      ]
    }
    ```
    If you're using an Azure Government cloud for Power BI, `location` should be the region name of the tenant. For example, if the tenant is in US Gov Texas, you should put  `"location": "usgovtexas"` in the ARM template. The list of Power BI US Government regions can be found in the [Power BI for US government article](/power-bi/enterprise/service-govus-overview#connect-government-and-global-azure-cloud-services).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > Use `Microsoft.PowerBI/privateLinkServicesForPowerBI` as `type` value, even though the resource is being created for Fabric.

1. Save the template. Then enter the following information.

    |Setting|Value|
    |:---|:---|
    |**Project details**||
    |Subscription|Select your subscription.|

    :::image type="content" source="./media/security-private-links-use/create-private-endpoint-dns-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create private endpoint DNS window.":::

1. Select **Next: Tags**, then **Next: Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Power BI private endpoint, it may not work for Fabric items. Currently, you need to create a new private endpoint to get support for Fabric items.

### Step 6. Connect to a VM using Bastion

Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines by providing lightweight, browser-based connectivity without the need to expose them through public IP addresses. For more information, see [What is Azure Bastion?](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview).

Connect to your VM using the following steps:

1. Create a subnet called *AzureBastionSubnet* in the virtual network you created in [Step 3](#step-3-create-a-virtual-network).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/security-private-links-use/create-azurebastionsubnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create AzureBastionSubnet." lightbox="./media/security-private-links-use/create-azurebastionsubnet.png":::

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *testVM* which we created in [Step 4](#step-4-create-a-virtual-machine).

1. Select the **Connect** button, and choose **Connect via Bastion** from the dropdown menu.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/security-private-links-use/connect-via-bastion.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Connect via Bastion option." lightbox="./media/security-private-links-use/connect-via-bastion.png":::

1. Select **Deploy Bastion**.

1.	On the **Bastion** page, enter the required authentication credentials, then click **Connect**.

### Step 7. Access Fabric privately from the VM

The next step is to access Fabric privately, from the virtual machine you created in the previous step, using the following steps: 

1. In the virtual machine, open PowerShell.

1. Enter `nslookup <tenant-object-id-without-hyphens>-api.privatelink.analysis.windows.net`.

1. You receive a response similar to the following message and can see that the private IP address is returned. You can see that the Onelake endpoint and Warehouse endpoint also return private IPs.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/security-private-links-use/nslookup-powershell.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing IP addresses returned in PowerShell." lightbox="./media/security-private-links-use/nslookup-powershell.png":::

1. Open the browser and go to *app.fabric.microsoft.com* to access Fabric privately.

### Step 8. Disable public access for Fabric

Finally, you can optionally disable public access for Fabric.

If you disable public access for Fabric, certain constraints on access to Fabric services are put into place, as described in the next section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you turn on *Block Internet Access*, some unsupported Fabric items will be disabled. Learn full list of limitations and considerations in [About private links](./security-private-links-overview.md)

To disable public access for Fabric, sign in to [Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) as an administrator, and navigate to the **Admin portal**. Select **Tenant settings** and scroll to the **Advanced networking** section. Enable the toggle button in the **Block Public Internet Access** tenant setting.

:::image type="content" source="./media/security-private-links-use/block-public-internet-access-tenant-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Block Public Internet Access tenant setting enabled.":::

It takes approximately 15 minutes for the system to disable your organization's access to Fabric from the public Internet.

## Completion of private endpoint configuration

Once you've followed the steps in the previous sections and the private link is successfully configured, your organization implements private links based on the following configuration selections, whether the selection is set upon initial configuration or subsequently changed.

If Azure Private Link is properly configured and **Block public Internet access** is **enabled**:

* Fabric is only accessible for your organization from private endpoints, and isn't accessible from the public Internet.
* Traffic from the virtual network targeting endpoints and scenarios that support private links are transported through the private link.
* Traffic from the virtual network targeting endpoints and scenarios that *don't* support private links will be blocked by the service, and won't work.
* There may be scenarios that don't support private links, which therefore will be blocked at the service when **Block public Internet access** is enabled.

If Azure Private Link is properly configured and **Block public Internet access** is **disabled**:

* Traffic from the public Internet will be allowed by Fabric services.
* Traffic from the virtual network targeting endpoints and scenarios that support private links are transported through the private link.
* Traffic from the virtual network targeting endpoints and scenarios that *don't* support private links are transported through the public Internet, and will be allowed by Fabric services.
* If the virtual network is configured to block public Internet access, scenarios that don't support private links will be blocked by the virtual network, and won't work.
