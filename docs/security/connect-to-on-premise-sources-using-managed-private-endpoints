# Connect on-premises data sources to Microsoft Fabric using managed private endpoints

With managed private endpoints, you can securely connect Microsoft Fabric workloads such as Spark or Data Pipelines to your **on-premises** or **custom-hosted data sources** through an approved private link setup.  
This approach ensures that traffic flows through the Microsoft backbone network instead of the public internet — maintaining end-to-end data privacy and compliance.

Common use cases include accessing:
- SQL Server or Oracle databases hosted in on-premise environments.
- Custom APIs or services hosted in virtual networks or self-managed data centers.
- Secure corporate data stores without exposing public endpoints.

## Overview

Fabric Managed Private Endpoints (MPEs) allow Fabric to establish **outbound** connections to approved data sources using **Private Link Services (PLS)**.  
The setup involves three main steps:

1. The on-premises administrator exposes the data source through a **Private Link Service (PLS)** or Azure Private Endpoint-enabled resource.
2. A Fabric workspace admin creates a **Managed Private Endpoint (MPE)** referencing the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or Azure resource ID.
3. The on-premises network admin reviews and approves the connection request in Azure.

Once approved, all Fabric workloads (like Spark, Notebooks, or Data Pipelines) can securely connect to the approved resource.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- A Microsoft Fabric workspace with admin permissions.
- The Azure subscription must have the **Microsoft.Network** resource provider registered.
- The on-premises resource must be reachable via a Private Link Service endpoint or through a connected Azure Virtual Network.
- Ensure DNS resolution for your data source FQDN is configured to route via the private endpoint.

---

## Step 1: Create a Private Link Service for your on-premises resource

To expose your on-premises or custom-hosted data source (like SQL Server) to Fabric, you must first create a **Private Link Service (PLS)** in Azure.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the search bar, enter **Private Link Service** and select **Create**.
3. Specify:
   - **Subscription** and **Resource group**
   - **Region**
   - **Name** of your private link service
4. Under **Frontend IP configuration**, associate the load balancer that routes traffic to your on-premises or virtual machine.
5. Define **Auto-approval subscription IDs** if you want to automatically approve connection requests from trusted Fabric tenants.

> [!TIP]
> If your data source is hosted on-premises, use Azure VPN Gateway or Azure ExpressRoute to connect your local network to Azure before configuring your PLS.

## Step 2: Create a Managed Private Endpoint using the Fabric REST API

Once your private link service is ready, you can configure Fabric to connect to your on-premises resource using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) by invoking the **Fabric REST API**.

You can use any REST API client such as **Bruno**, **Insomnia**, or **Postman** to send the request.

### Step 2.1: Get an authentication token

Before calling the Fabric REST API, obtain a **Bearer token** using your Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) credentials.

You can do this using Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
az account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com
This command returns a JSON object containing the access token.
Copy the value of "accessToken" to use as your Authorization header.

Step 2.2: Construct the API request
Use the following endpoint and payload to create a managed private endpoint:

Request

bash
Copy code
POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/network/privateEndpoints
Headers

Key	Value
Authorization	Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type	application/json

Body

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "onprem-sql-endpoint",
  "type": "CustomFQDN",
  "fqdn": "sqlserver.corp.contoso.com",
  "description": "Private connection to on-prem SQL via Azure Private Link Service"
}
You can test this call directly from Bruno, Postman, or Insomnia:

Open your preferred REST API client.

Create a new POST request.

Paste the endpoint URL, replacing {workspaceId} with your Fabric workspace ID.

Add the headers and JSON body shown above.

Send the request.

Step 2.3: Verify the connection request
A successful API response returns the following JSON:

json
{
  "id": "f2cbd8d1-23f1-4b9a-9db2-23ad1e7b5129",
  "name": "onprem-sql-endpoint",
  "type": "CustomFQDN",
  "fqdn": "sqlserver.corp.contoso.com",
  "provisioningState": "PendingApproval",
  "createdBy": "user@contoso.com"
}
At this point, the private connection request has been sent to the target data source administrator (for example, the owner of your Private Link Service in Azure).
Once they approve the connection, the provisioning state updates to Approved, and you can begin accessing your on-premises data securely from Fabric.

Example: Using Bruno or Insomnia
You can also create and test the endpoint directly in Bruno or Insomnia:

Set the Request type to POST.

Paste the Fabric REST API endpoint.

In Auth, select Bearer Token, and paste the token retrieved earlier.

In Body, paste the JSON payload.

Click Send.

The API will respond with the managed private endpoint details and connection status.

Fabric will attempt to initiate a private connection request.  
Your network administrator will see this pending request in the Azure portal under the associated **Private Link Service → Private endpoint connections** blade.

---

## Step 3: Approve the private endpoint connection request

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to your **Private Link Service** resource.
3. Select **Private endpoint connections** under the **Networking** section.
4. Review the pending connection request from Microsoft Fabric.
5. Choose **Approve** and provide an optional justification.

Once approved, the connection status in Fabric changes to **Approved**. You can now securely connect to your on-premises data source.

---

## Step 4: Access your on-premises SQL Server from Fabric notebooks

After approval, your managed private endpoint becomes active and can be used from Spark notebooks or Data Pipelines.

Example using PySpark to connect to an on-premises SQL Server:

```pyspark
serverName = "sqlserver.corp.contoso.com"
database = "SalesDB"
dbPort = 1433
dbUserName = "<username>"
dbPassword = "<password or Key Vault reference>"

jdbcURL = f"jdbc:sqlserver://{serverName}:{dbPort};database={database}"
connectionProps = {
    "user": dbUserName,
    "password": dbPassword,
    "driver": "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver"
}

df = spark.read.jdbc(url=jdbcURL, table="dbo.Customers", properties=connectionProps)
display(df)

# Write back to your Fabric Lakehouse
df.write.mode("overwrite").format("delta").saveAsTable("Customers")
