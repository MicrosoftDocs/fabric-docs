# Guest user sharing

Sharing items with guest users in Fabric is similar to sharing items with guest users in Power BI, except that in Fabric, you can only share items by sharing the workspace. Explicit sharing of particular items with guest users isn't supported, except for reports, dashboards, semantic models, and apps.

For more information about Guest user sharing in Power BI, see [Distribute Power BI content to external guest users with Microsoft Entra B2B](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b).
