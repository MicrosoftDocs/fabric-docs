# Customer-managed keys for Fabric workspaces

Microsoft Fabric encrypts all data-at-rest using Microsoft managed keys. With customer-managed keys for Fabric workspaces, you can use your [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) keys to add another layer of protection to the data in your Microsoft Fabric workspaces. A customer-managed key provides greater flexibility, allowing you to manage its rotation, control access, and usage auditing. It also helps organizations meet data governance needs and comply with data protection and encryption standards.

All Fabric data stores are encrypted at rest with Microsoft-managed keys. Customer-managed keys use envelope encryption, where a Key Encryption Key (KEK) encrypts a Data Encryption Key (DEK). When using customer-managed keys, the Microsoft managed DEK encrypts your data, and then the DEK is encrypted using your customer-managed KEK. Use of a KEK that never leaves Key Vault allows the data encryption keys themselves to be encrypted and controlled.

## Prerequisites

Customer-managed key for Fabric workspaces requires an initial setup. This setup includes enabling the Fabric encryption tenant setting, configuring Azure Key Vault, and granting the Fabric Platform CMK app access to Azure Key Vault. Once the setup is complete, a user with an *admin* [workspace role](../fundamentals/roles-workspaces.md#roles-in-workspaces-in-microsoft-fabric) can enable the feature on the workspace.

### Step 1: Enable the Fabric tenant setting

A [Fabric administrator](../admin/microsoft-fabric-admin.md#power-platform-and-fabric-admin-roles) needs to make sure that the [Apply customer-managed keys](../admin/service-admin-portal-encryption.md) setting is enabled. For more information, see [Encryption tenant setting](../admin/service-admin-portal-encryption.md) article.

### Step 2: Create a Service Principal for the Fabric Platform CMK app

Fabric uses the *Fabric Platform CMK* app to access your Azure Key Vault. For the app to work, a [service principal](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser#service-principal-object) must be created for the tenant. This process is performed by a user that has Microsoft Entra ID privileges, such as a [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).

Follow the instructions in [Create an enterprise application from a multitenant application in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant) to create a service principal for an application called *Fabric Platform CMK* in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

### Step 3: Configure Azure Key Vault

You need to configure your Key Vault so that Fabric can access it. This step is performed by a user that has Key Vault privileges, such as a [Key Vault Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/security#key-vault-administrator). For more information, see Azure [Security](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#security) roles.

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to your Key Vault. If you don't have Key Vault, follow the instructions in [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).

2. In your Key Vault, configure the following settings:
    * [Soft delete](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview) -  Enabled
    * [Purge protection](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview#purge-protection) - Enabled

3. In your Key Vault, open **Access control (IAM)**.

4. From the *Add* dropdown, select **Add Role assignment**.

5. Select the **Members** tab and then click on **Select members**.

6. In the *Select members pane*, search for **Fabric Platform CMK**

7. Select the *Fabric Platform CMK* app and then **Select**.

8. Select the **Role** tab and search for [Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/security#key-vault-crypto-service-encryption-user) or a role that enables *get, wrapkey, and unwrap key* permissions.

9. Select **Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User**.

10. Select **Review + assign** and then select **Review + assign** to confirm your choice.

### Step 4: Create an Azure Key Vault key

To create an Azure Key Vault key, follow the instructions in [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).

## Key Vault requirements

Fabric only supports [versionless customer-managed keys](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation#key-rotation-policy), which are keys in the `https://{vault-name}.vault.azure.net/{key-type}/{key-name}` format. Fabric checks the key vault daily for a new version, and uses the latest version available. To avoid having a period where you can't access data in the workspace after a new key is created, wait 24 hours before disabling the older version.

Your key must be an *RSA* key. The supported sizes are:

* 2,048 bit
* 3,072 bit
* 4,096 bit

For more information, see [About keys](/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys).

## Enable encryption using customer-managed keys

Follow the steps in this section to use customer-managed keys in your Fabric workspace.

1. From your Fabric workspace, select **Workspace settings**.

1. From the *Workspace settings* pane, select **Encryption**.

1. Enable **Apply customer-managed keys**.

1. In the **Key identifier** field, enter your customer-managed key identifier.

1. Select **Apply**.

Once you complete these steps, your workspace is encrypted with a customer-managed key. This means existing and future items in the workspace will be encrypted by the customer-managed key you used for the setup. You can review the encryption status *Active, In progress or Failed* in the **Encryption** tab in workspace settings. Items for which encryption is in progress or failed are listed categorically too. The key needs to remain active in the Key Vault while encryption is in progress *(Status: In progress)*. Refresh the page to view the latest encryption status. If encryption has failed for some items in the workspace, you can retry using a different key.

## Revoke access

To revoke access to data in a workspace that's encrypted using a customer-managed key, revoke the key in the Azure Key Vault. After 30 minutes from the time the key is revoked, read and write calls to the workspace fail.

You can revoke a customer-managed encryption key by changing the access policy, by changing the permissions on the key vault, or by deleting the key.

To reinstate access, restore access to the customer-managed key in the Key Vault.

## Disable the encryption

To disable encrypting the workspace using a customer-managed key, go to *Workspace settings* disable **Apply customer-managed keys**. The workspace remains encrypted using Microsoft Managed keys.

You can't disable customer-managed keys while encryption for any of the Fabric items in your workspace is in progress.

Encryption is currently available in selected regions and will only work for workspaces using capacities in those regions.

## Considerations and limitations

Before you configure your Fabric workspace with a customer-managed key, consider the following limitations:

* Customer-managed keys are currently supported for the following Fabric items:
  * Lakehouse
  * Environment
  * Spark Job Definition
  * API for GraphQL
  * ML model
  * Experiment
  * Data Pipeline
  * Dataflow
  * Industry solutions

* This feature can't be enabled for a workspace that contains unsupported items. 

* When customer-managed key encryption for a Fabric workspace is enabled, only supported items can be created in that workspace. To use unsupported items, create them in a different workspace that does not have this feature enabled. 

* The data listed below isn't protected with customer-managed keys:

  * All data stored in the Spark Clusters (data stored in temp discs as part of  shuffle or data spills or RDD caches in a spark application) are not protected. This includes all the Spark Jobs from Notebooks, Lakehouses, Spark Job Definitions, Lakehouse Table Load and Maintenance jobs, Shortcut Transforms, Fabric Materialized View Refresh.
  * The job logs stored in the history server
  * Libraries attached as part of environments or added as part of the Spark session customization using magic commands are not protected 
  * Lakehouse column names, table format, table compression, SQL endpoint
  * Metadata generated when creating a Data pipeline and Copy job, such as DB name, table, schema
  * Metadata of ML model and experiment, like the model name, version, metrics

* CMK is only supported in the following regions: East US, Germany West Central, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, UAE North, UK South, West Europe, and West US. To use CMK, your home region and capacity must be in a supported region.

* CMK is supported on all [F SKUs](../enterprise/licenses.md).

* CMK is not supported when Azure Key Vault firewall setting is enabled.

* CMK can be enabled and disabled for the workspace while the tenant level encryption setting is on. Once the tenant setting is turned off, you can no longer enable CMK for workspaces in that tenant or disable CMK for workspaces that already have CMK turned on in that tenant. Data in workspaces that enabled CMK before the tenant setting was turned off will remain encrypted with the customer managed key. Keep the associated key active to be able to unwrap data in that workspace.
