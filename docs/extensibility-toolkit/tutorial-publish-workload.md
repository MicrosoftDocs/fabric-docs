# How to publish and manage your workload

This article describes how to upload and manage a workload to Microsoft Fabric. Workloads enhance the usability of your service within a familiar workspace, eliminating the need to leave the Fabric environment. Fabric workloads increase user engagement and improve your application's discoverability in the Fabric marketplace. The Fabric workspace includes various components, known as Fabric items, which handle storage, analysis, and presentation of your data.

## Prerequisites

To deploy a workload, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A Fabric account with admin permissions.
* The [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/) workload solution that you want to deploy. For information about creating a workload solution, see [Create a new Item](./tutorial-create-new-fabric-item.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When DevGateway is connected to the Fabric backend, the developer workload takes precedence over the workload that's activated in the tenant. If you try to create an item in a workspace that's registered in the DevGateway configuration,, the Fabric backend calls your local workload instead of the activated workload.

## Upload a workload

To upload a workload to Microsoft Fabric:

1. Sign in to [Fabric](https://powerbi.com) with an admin account.
