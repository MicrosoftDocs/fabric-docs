The OneLake Explorer sample item demonstrates how to build a Fabric workload item that interacts with OneLake. It provides a file explorer interface allowing users to browse, view, and edit files stored in OneLake, and preview table files.

## Overview

The OneLake Explorer item showcases several key capabilities of the Fabric Extensibility Toolkit:

* **OneLake Integration**: Connects to OneLake to list files and folders.
* **File Editing**: Integrates the Monaco editor to provide a rich code editing experience for various file types (JSON, XML, TypeScript, etc.).
* **Tabbed Interface**: Supports opening multiple files in tabs, managing state for each open file.
* **Table Preview**: Includes a view mode for previewing table data.
* **Item Picker**: Demonstrates how to use the Fabric item picker to select OneLake items (like Lakehouses) to explore.
* **Shortcuts**: Allows creating shortcuts to other OneLake items.
