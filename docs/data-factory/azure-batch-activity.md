# Use the Azure Batch activity to run a command on an Azure Batch instance

The Azure Batch activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to run a command against an Azure Batch instance.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add an Azure Batch activity to a pipeline with UI

To use an Azure Batch activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Create the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for Azure Batch in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may need to expand the menu and scroll down to see the Azure Batch activity as highlighted in the following screenshot.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Azure Batch activity settings

Select the **Settings** tab, then you can choose an existing or create a new **Azure Batch connection**, provide a **Command** to be executed, and a **Resource connection** to a storage account. You can also specify a specific **Folder path** within the storage account and a **Retention time in days** for data to be retained there, as well as add extended properties of your own.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
