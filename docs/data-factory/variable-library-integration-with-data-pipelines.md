# Variable library integration with pipelines

The [Variable library](../cicd/variable-library/variable-library-overview.md) is a new item type in Microsoft Fabric that allows users to define and manage variables at the workspace level, so they could soon be used across various workspace items, such as pipelines, notebooks, Shortcut for lakehouse and more. It provides a unified and centralized way to manage configurations, reducing the need for hardcoded values and simplifying your CI/CD processes, making it easier to manage configurations across different environments.

## How to use Variable library with pipelines

### Create a Variable Library

1. Navigate to your workspace and create a new item.

1. Use the filter to find Variable library or scroll down to the Develop data section.

1. Select Variable library to create a new Variable library. Choose a name and hit Create.

1. Once the Variable library is created, you are taken to the homepage. Select **+ New** to add a new variable.

1. Once you add a new variable, you can configure your variable and set the Name, Type, and Default value set. You can also add Notes.

1. Add Alternative value sets as you need (for example, different values for different deployment pipeline environments). After you set a name and select **Create**, you can edit the variable values and choose value set to make active.

1.	Save your changes once you're done.

### Use Variable library variables in your pipeline

1. To use a Variable library variable in your pipeline, create a new pipeline or navigate to an existing pipeline.

   :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/create-new-data-pipeline.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/create-new-data-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the create new item button in the top left corner and the pipeline item highlighted.":::

1. In your pipeline, you need to create a reference to your variable library variable in the bottom panel.

   :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/new-variable-library-reference-in-pipeline.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/new-variable-library-reference-in-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the Library variables tab and the +New button in the bottom panel of the pipeline canvas.":::

1. After you select **+ New**, a pop-up will open that shows you all your Variable libraries. You can use this picker to select your Variable library variable and select **Ok**.

1. Once you have added your library variable references, add your pipeline activities. In the activity settings, select **Add dynamic content** for the setting you want to parameterize. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/add-dynamic-content.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/add-dynamic-content.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Add dynamic content highlighted in the settings of a Lookup activity.":::

1. The expression builder opens. If you don't see **Library variables**, select the 3 dots next to **Functions** and select **Library variables**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/pipeline-expression-builder.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/pipeline-expression-builder.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 3 dots next to Functions in the expression builder and the Library variables tab highlighted.":::

1. Select your Library variable reference to add a new expression to the expression builder. Then, select **Ok** to add your expression. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/add-expression.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/add-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a Library variable reference highlighted to be added to the expression builder."

      :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/add-expression-final.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/add-expression-final.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the expression set in the expression builder.":::

1. You'll now see that the dynamic content is added to your activity setting. 

      :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/dynamic-content-populated.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/dynamic-content-populated.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the expression set as dynamic content in the Lookup activity settings.":::

1. You can preview your data by selecting **Preview data**. This will open a new pane that shows the value of your library variable. Select **Ok** to get a preview of your data.

      :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/preview-data.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/preview-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the preview data option.":::

      :::image type="content" source="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/preview-data-pane.png" lightbox="media/variable-library-integration-with-data-pipelines/preview-data-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the preview data pane.":::


1. Save and run your pipeline as you normally would. You'll see that the value passed is whatever value is set as Active in your Variable library.

## Known limitations

The following known limitations apply to the integration of Variable library in pipelines in Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric:

- The Variable library supports Boolean, Datetime, Guid, Integer, Number, and String as data types. In your pipeline, you will see Boolean as Bool type, Datetime as String type, Guid as String type, Integer as Int type, and String as String type. Number types are not supported in pipelines. 
- External connection parameterization is supported with variable library integrated with pipelines. However, you must look up the GUID for your connection from Settings | Manage connections and gateways. There you will find the GUID for your connection by selecting Settings next to your connection name.
