# dbt job in Microsoft Fabric (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is in [preview](/fabric/fundamentals/preview).

[dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/) job in Fabric brings the power of dbt (Data Build Tool) directly into the Fabric experience. You can transform data with SQL in a familiar, unified environment. Build, test, and deploy dbt models on top of your Fabric data warehouse or other supported warehouses—no need to install local tools or manage external orchestration.

You can develop and manage transformation logic entirely within Fabric. Author your models, define dependencies, and run tests in one place while you use Fabric's enterprise-grade security and governance.

Fabric integrates with dbt Core to provide:

- No-code setup for onboarding and configuration
- Native scheduling and monitoring to keep workflows reliable and transparent
- Visual insights into dbt runs, tests, and lineage—all within the same workspace as your pipelines and reports

This approach combines the flexibility of code-first development with the simplicity of low-code orchestration so analytics and engineering teams can collaborate and scale transformations across the organization.

## How to enable dbt jobs preview

1. Go to the [admin portal](/fabric/admin/admin-center) in Fabric.
1. Under **Tenant settings**, enable the **dbt jobs (preview)** feature for your organization or specific security groups.

## Required permissions and access

- In your Fabric workspace, you need a [Contributor role](/fabric/fundamentals/roles-workspaces) or higher to create or manage dbt jobs.
- For the target Fabric Data Warehouse, you need [read/write permissions](/fabric/data-warehouse/share-warehouse-manage-permissions#manage-permissions) to run dbt transformations.
- You need both build and read/write access to linked datasets and connections.

## Supported adapters

You can connect a dbt job to multiple data sources by using supported adapters. This feature enables dbt models to run transformations directly on your chosen platform. Here are the currently supported adapters:

- Fabric Warehouse
- Snowflake
- PostgreSQL
- Azure SQL Server

## dbt job runtime

In Fabric, a dbt Job Runtime is a managed execution environment that provides a consistent and secure way to run dbt jobs. It simplifies execution by offering a versioned environment that includes dbt capabilities, ensuring reliability and performance across workloads. 

Currently, when you create a dbt job, it uses **dtbjob runtime v1.0** by default. This runtime supports **dbt Core v1.9** and includes adapters for **Fabric Warehouse**, **Azure SQL Database**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Snowflake**.

## Limitations

- **No build caching**: Currently, preview only supports compiling and executing a project fresh from the source. dbt artifacts produced from previous runs aren't available for recompilation.
- **Incremental models**: Make sure you have proper primary keys and unique constraints for incremental builds.
- **Adapter constraints**: Some partner adapters aren't yet supported in Fabric. See [the current supported adapters](#supported-adapters).
- The output currently has a 1-MB size limit. When a run exceeds this threshold, the job fails with the following error: `{"errorCode":"2001","message":"The length of execution output is over limit (around 1M currently).","failureType":"UserError","target":"DbtItem","details":[]}`
