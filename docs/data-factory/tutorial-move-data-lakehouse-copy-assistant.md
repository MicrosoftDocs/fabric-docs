# Move data from Azure SQL DB into Lakehouse via copy assistant

This tutorial describes the steps to move data into Lakehouse.

Two approaches are provided using the copy assistant:

1. The first approach moves source data into destination tables with delta format.
2. The second approach moves source data into destination files.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.
- A workspace is created.
- A Lakehouse is created in your workspace.

## Move files into Lakehouse as tables in delta format via copy assistant

Follow these steps to set up your copy activity.

### Step 1: Start with copy assistant

1. Open an existing data pipeline or create a new data pipeline.

1. Select **Copy data assistant** on the canvas to open the wizard and get started. Or select **Use copy assistant** from the **Copy data** drop down list under **Activities** tab on the ribbon.

### Step 2: Configure your source

1. Choose your data source by choosing a data source type. In this tutorial, we'll use Azure SQL Database as an example. Search  on the **Choose data source** screen to find and select **Azure SQL Database**.

1. Create a connection to your data source by filling in the required connection information on the panel.

   After you fill in the required connection information on the panel, select **Next**.

   If you didn't already select a database initially, a list of databases is presented for you to select from.

### Step 3: Configure your destination

1. Choose **Lakehouse** as your destination and then select **Next**.

   Enter a Lakehouse name, then select **Create and connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/create-new-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the data store.":::

2. Configure and map your source data to the destination Lakehouse table. Select **Tables** for the **Root folder** and **Load to a new table** for **Load settings**. Provide a **Table** name and select **Next**.

3. Review your configuration, and uncheck the **Start data transfer immediately** checkbox. Then select **Next** to finish the assistant experience.

### Step 4: Save your data pipeline and run it to load data

1. Select **Run** from the **Home** toolbar and then select **Save and run** when prompted.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-move-data-lakehouse-copy-assistant/save-pipeline-and-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Run from the Home tab of the pipeline editor window.":::

2. For each activity that was run, you can select the activity's corresponding link in the Output tab after the pipeline runs to view the details the activity. In this case we have 2 individual copy activities that ran - one for each table copied from SQL Azure to the Lakehouse. When you select the activity's details link, you can see how mmuch data was read and written and how much space the data consumed in the source and destination, as well as throughput speed and other details.

### Step 5: View your tables from Lakehouse

1. Go to your Lakehouse and refresh your **Lake view** to see the latest data ingested.

2. Switch to **Table view** to view the data in table.

   > [!Note]
   > Currently data lands into Lakehouse Tables folders (a managed area) in Delta format only. Those files will be automatically registered as a table and be visible under Table view from Lakehouse portal.
   > Only the first layer folders under Tables will be registered as delta table.
   > Browsing or Previewing from Lakehouse Table isn't supported yet.
   > Data that gets loaded into the same table will be appended. Delete or Update to tables isn't supported yet.
