# Use the Wait activity to control execution flow

When you use a Wait activity in a pipeline, the pipeline waits for the specified period of time before continuing with execution of subsequent activities.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add a Wait activity to a pipeline with UI

To use a Wait activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Create the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for **Wait** in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

1. Select the new Wait activity on the canvas if it isn't already selected.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Wait activity settings

Select the **Settings** tab of the Wait activity. Specify a number of seconds for execution to wait before continuing. You can directly enter a number, or use a dynamic expression to derive a value from any of the available functions and variables for expressions.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

This example will simply wait the specified period and terminate, although in a real-world setting, you would normally add other activities after or before the Wait activity to achieve a more productive purpose. When your pipeline is finished, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
