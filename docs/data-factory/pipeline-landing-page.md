# Explore data solutions efficiently using the Data Factory pipeline landing page

The pipeline landing page in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric is the first page you are presented when you create a new pipeline. This page offers an updated and user-friendly experience to make it easy for you to find and build useful data solutions fast. You can even create your first pipeline in as little as 5 minutes using pre-defined templates to build powerful solutions, allowing you quickly transfer data from many various sources to your preferred destinations with rich orchestration capabilities as well.


## Create a pipeline from the landing page

Let's get started exploring data solutions from the pipeline landing page! Below the pipeline menus and toolbar at the top of the window, you're presented with several cards:

Of course, you can start with a blank pipeline canvas and add activities directly, but the cards provided give you a number of other ways to get started.

## Copy data assistant

With this option, the copy data assistant provides a guided copy wizard to easily ingest data from any supported sources to any supported destination.

## Practice with sample data

This option allows you to use sample data to walk through a copy operation moving data into a Lakehouse in just 5 minutes. All you need to do is choose a Lakehouse destination.

## Templates

This option allows you to choose from pre-defined templates that make it easy to implement powerful data solutions for many different scenarios.

## Pipeline activity

Pipelines feature a [library of activities](activity-overview.md) (for example, Copy data, Filter, ForEach, Teams and Outlook notifications) that enable users to build rich and sophisticated data orchestration.
