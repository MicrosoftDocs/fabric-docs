# Module 3: Automate and send notifications with Data Factory

You can complete this module in about 10 minutes. In this final part of our tutorial, you learn to send an email notifying you when all the jobs in a pipeline are complete, and configure the pipeline to run on a schedule.

## Prerequisites

[Module 1 of this tutorial series: Create a pipeline with Data Factory](tutorial-end-to-end-pipeline.md)

## Add an Office 365 Outlook activity to your pipeline

1. Open the pipeline you created in [Module 1: Create a pipeline in Data Factory](tutorial-end-to-end-pipeline.md).

1. Select the **Activities** tab in the pipeline editor and find the Office Outlook activity.

1. Select the new Office Outlook activity and select its **Settings** tab.
1. Sign in to your Office account if you haven't already, and when prompted, grant consent to use your email address.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/pick-your-email-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Pick an account dialog.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > The service doesn't currently support personal email. You must use an enterprise email address.

1. Select and drag the **On success** path (a green checkbox on the top right side of the activity in the pipeline canvas) from your Copy activity to your new Office 365 Outlook activity.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/connect-copy-activity-to-outlook.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the connection of the success output from the Copy activity to the new Office 365 Outlook activity.":::

1. Select the Office 365 Outlook activity from the pipeline canvas, then select the **Settings** tab of the property area below the canvas to configure the email.

   - Enter your email address in the **To** section. If you want to use several addresses, use **;** to separate them. 
   - For the **Subject**, select the field so that the **Add dynamic content** option appears, and then select it to display the pipeline expression builder canvas. 
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/configure-email-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the configuration of the Office 365 Outlook email settings tab.":::

1. The **Pipeline expression builder** dialog appears. Enter the following expression, then select **OK**:
     
   _@concat('DI in an Hour Pipeline Succeeded with Pipeline Run Id', pipeline().RunId)_

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/pipeline-expression-builder.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the pipeline expression builder with the expression provided for the Subject line of the email.":::

1. For the **Body**, select the field again and choose the **Add dynamic content** option when it appears below the text area. Add the following expression again (with your own copy activity name) in the **Pipeline expression builder** dialog that appears, then select **OK**:

   *@concat('RunID =  ', pipeline().RunId, ' ; ', 'Copied rows ', activity('Copy data1').output.rowsCopied, ' ; ','Throughput ', activity('Copy data1').output.throughput)*

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Replace **Copy data1** with the name of your own pipeline copy activity.

1. Finally select the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and choose **Run**. Then select **Save and run** again on the confirmation dialog to execute these activities.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/run-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the pipeline editor window with the Run button highlighted on the menu.":::

1. After the pipeline runs successfully, check your email to find the confirmation email sent from the pipeline.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/email-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the email generated by the pipeline.":::
   
## Schedule pipeline execution

Once you finish developing and testing your pipeline, you can schedule it to execute automatically.

1. On the **Home** tab of the pipeline editor window, select **Schedule**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/schedule-button.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Schedule button on the menu of the Home tab in the pipeline editor.":::

1. Configure the schedule as required. The example here schedules the pipeline to execute daily at 8:00 PM until the end of the year.

## _(Optional)_ Add a Dataflow activity to the pipeline

You can also add the dataflow you created in [Module 2: Create a dataflow in Data Factory](tutorial-end-to-end-dataflow.md) into the pipeline.

1. Hover over the green line connecting the Copy activity and the Office 365 Outlook activity on your pipeline canvas, and select the **+** button to insert a new activity.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/insert-activity-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the insert activity button for the connection between the Copy activity and the Office 365 Outlook activity on the pipeline canvas.":::

1. Choose **Dataflow** from the menu that appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end-integration/insert-dataflow-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of Dataflow from the insert activity menu on the pipeline canvas.":::

1. The newly created Dataflow activity is inserted between the Copy activity and the Office 365 Outlook activity, and selected automatically, showing its properties in the area below the canvas. Select the **Settings** tab on the properties area, and then select your dataflow created in [Module 2: Create a dataflow in Data Factory](tutorial-end-to-end-dataflow.md).

## Related content

In our end-to-end tutorial for your first data integration pipeline using Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric, you learned how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Use a Copy activity to ingest raw data from a source store into a table in a data Lakehouse.
> - Use a Dataflow activity to process the data and move it into a new table in the Lakehouse.
> - Use an Office 365 Outlook activity to send an email notifying you once all the jobs are complete.
> - Configure the pipeline to run on a scheduled basis.
> - _(Optional)_ Insert a Dataflow activity in an existing pipeline flow.

Since you completed the tutorial, you're ready to build your own pipelines and flows.
