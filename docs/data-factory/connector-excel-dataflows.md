# Connect to an Excel workbook in dataflows

You can connect to Excel workbooks in Dataflow Gen2 using the Excel connector provided by Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to an Excel workbook. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to an Excel workbook in Dataflow Gen2:

* To get started using the Excel connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric).
* Be sure to install or set up any [Excel prerequisites](/power-query/connectors/excel#prerequisites) before connecting to the Excel connector.
* To connect to the Excel connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to an Excel workbook from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/excel#connect-to-an-excel-workbook-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.
