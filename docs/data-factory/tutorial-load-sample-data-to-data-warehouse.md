# Load Sample data to Data Warehouse

In this tutorial, you build a data pipeline to move a Sample dataset to the Data Warehouse. This experience shows you a quick demo about how to use pipeline copy activity and how to load data into Data Warehouse.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] tenant account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.
- Make sure you have a [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] enabled Workspace: [Create a workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md).
- Make sure you have already created a Data Warehouse. To create it, refer to [Create a Data Warehouse](../data-warehouse/create-warehouse.md)

## Create a data pipeline

1. Navigate to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/).
1. Select the Power BI icon in the bottom left of the screen, then select **Data factory** to open homepage of Data Factory.

1. Navigate to your [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] workspace. If you created a new workspace in the prior Prerequisites section, use this one.

1. Select **Data pipeline** and then input a pipeline name to create a new pipeline.

## Copy data using pipeline

In this session, you start to build your pipeline by following below steps about copying from a sample dataset provided by pipeline into Data Warehouse.

### Step 1: Start with the Copy assistant

1. Select **Copy data assistant** on the canvas to open the **copy assistant** tool to get started. Or Select **Use copy assistant** from the **Copy data** drop down list under the **Activities** tab on the ribbon.

### Step 2: Configure your source

1. Choose the **NYC Taxi - Green** from the **Sample data** options for your data source.

1. In the **Connect to data source** section of the **Copy data** assistant, a preview of the sample data **NYC Taxi - Green** is displayed. Select **Next** to move on to the data destination.

### Step 3: Configure your destination

1. Select the **OneLake** tab and choose an existing **Warehouse**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-sample-data-to-data-warehouse/data-warehouse-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of the Warehouse destination.":::
 
1. Configure and map your source data to the destination Warehouse table by entering **Table**, then select **Next** one more time.

1. Configure other settings on **Settings** page. In this tutorial, select **Next** directly since you don't need to use staging and copy command.

### Step 4: Review and run your copy activity

1. Review your copy activity settings in the previous steps and select **Save + Run** to start the activity. Or you can revisit the previous steps in the tool to edit your settings, if needed.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-sample-data-to-data-warehouse/review-create-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review + create page of the Copy data assistant highlighting source and destination.":::

1. The Copy activity is added to your new data pipeline canvas. All settings including advanced settings for the activity are available in the tabs below the pipeline canvas when the created **Copy data** activity is selected.

## Schedule your data pipeline

1. You can monitor the running process and check the results on the **Output** tab below the pipeline canvas.  Select the run details button (with the glasses icon highlighted) to view the run details.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-sample-data-to-data-warehouse/run-details-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Output tab of the pipeline run in-progress with the Details button highlighted in the run status.":::

1. The run details show how much data was read and written and various other details about the run.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-load-sample-data-to-data-warehouse/run-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the run details window.":::

1. You can also schedule the pipeline to run with a specific frequency as required. Below is an example scheduling the pipeline to run every 15 minutes. You can also specify the **Start** time and **End** time for your schedule. If you don't specify a start time, the start time is the time your schedule applies. If you don't specify an end time, your pipeline run will keep recurring every 15 minutes.
