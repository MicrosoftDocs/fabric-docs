# Set up your Google Analytics connection

This article outlines the steps to create a Google Analytics connection.


## Supported authentication types

The Google Analytics connector supports the following authentication types for copy and Dataflow Gen2 respectively.  

|Authentication type |Copy |Dataflow Gen2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Organizational account| n/a | âˆš |

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to Google Analytics data. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to Google Analytics data in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the Google Analytics connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric-preview).
- Be sure to install or set up any [Google Analytics prerequisites](/power-query/connectors/google-analytics#prerequisites) before connecting to the Google Analytics connector.
- To connect to the Google Analytics connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to Google Analytics data from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/google-analytics#connect-to-google-analytics-data-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.

## Set up your connection in a data pipeline

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric doesn't currently support Google Analytics data in data pipelines.
