# How to access on-premises data sources in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric is a cloud-based, data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and manage workflows for various data sources. When your data sources are located on-premises, Microsoft provides the on-premises Data Gateway to securely bridge the gap between your on-premises environment and the cloud. This document guides you through the process of creating and connecting to this gateway to access your on-premises data sources.

## Available connection types

For a comprehensive list of the connectors supported for on-premises data types and details for how to connect to each type, refer to [Data pipeline connectors in Microsoft Fabric](pipeline-support.md) and your source's specific connector page.

## Create an on-premises data gateway

1. An on-premises data gateway is a software application designed to be installed within a local network environment. It provides a means to directly install the gateway onto your local machine. For detailed instructions on how to download and install the on-premises data gateway, refer to [Install an on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install).

   >Refer to the [data pipeline connectors in Microsoft Fabric article](pipeline-support.md) and specific connector articles for details like supported authentication types for your source or troubleshooting information.

## Connect your on-premises data source to a Dataflow Gen2 in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

In this example, you'll create a Dataflow Gen2 to load data from an on-premises data source to a cloud destination.

1. [Create an on-premises data gateway to connect to your source.](#create-an-on-premises-data-gateway)

1. [Create a connection to your on-premises data source.](#create-a-connection-for-your-on-premises-data-source)

1. Go to your workspace and create a Dataflow Gen2.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-on-premises-data/create-new-dataflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a demo workspace with the new Dataflow Gen2 option highlighted.":::

1. Add a new source to the dataflow and select the connection established in the previous step.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-on-premises-data/connect-data-source.png" lightbox="media/how-to-access-on-premises-data/connect-data-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Connect to data source dialog in a Dataflow Gen2 with an on-premises source selected.":::

1. You can use the Dataflow Gen2 to perform any necessary data transformations based on your requirements.

## Use on-premises data in a pipeline

In this example, you'll create and run a [pipeline](pipeline-runs.md) to load data from an on-premises data source into a cloud destination.

1. [Create an on-premises data gateway to connect to your source.](#create-an-on-premises-data-gateway)

1. [Create a connection to your on-premises data source.](#create-a-connection-for-your-on-premises-data-source)

1. Go to your workspace and create a data pipeline.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-on-premises-data/create-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to create a new data pipeline.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > You need to configure the firewall to allow outbound connections ***.frontend.clouddatahub.net**  from the gateway for Fabric pipeline capabilities.
