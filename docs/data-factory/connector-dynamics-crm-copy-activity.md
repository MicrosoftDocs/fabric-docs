# How to configure Dynamics CRM in a copy activity

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in a data pipeline to copy data from and to Dynamics CRM.

## Prerequisites

To use this connector with Entra ID service-principal authentication, you must set up server-to-server (S2S) authentication in Dynamics CRM. First register the application user (Service Principal) in Microsoft Entra. For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). 

During application registration you will need to create that user in Dynamics CRM and grant permissions. Those permissions can either be granted directly or indirectly by adding the application user to a team which has been granted permissions in Dynamics CRM. For more information on how to set up an application user to authenticate with Dynamics CRM, see [Use single-tenant server-to-server authentication](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/use-single-tenant-server-server-authentication).

## Supported configuration

For the configuration of each tab under copy activity, go to the following sections respectively.

- [General](#general)  
- [Source](#source)
- [Destination](#destination)
- [Mapping](#mapping)
- [Settings](#settings)

### General

For **General** tab configuration, go to [General settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings).

### Source

Go to **Source** tab to configure your copy activity source. See the following content for the detailed configuration.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-dynamics-crm/source.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing source tab and the list of properties." :::

The following properties are **required**:

- **Data store type**: Select **External**.
- **Connection**: Select an existing Dynamics CRM connection from the connection list. If no connection exists, then create a new Dynamics CRM connection by selecting **New**.
- **Connection type**: Select **Dynamics CRM**.
- **Use query**: Specify the way used to read data. You can choose **Entity name** to read data using entity name or **Query** to use query to read data.
  - **Entity name**: Select your entity name from the drop-down list, or select **Edit** to enter it manually. It is the logical name of the entity to retrieve.
  - **Query**: Using FetchXML to read data from Dynamics CRM. FetchXML is a proprietary query language that is used in Dynamics online and on-premises. See the following example. To learn more, see [Build queries with FetchXML](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/developers-guide/gg328332(v=crm.8)).

    **Sample FetchXML query**:

    ```XML
    <fetch>
      <entity name="account">
        <attribute name="accountid" />
        <attribute name="name" />
        <attribute name="marketingonly" />
        <attribute name="modifiedon" />
        <order attribute="modifiedon" descending="false" />
        <filter type="and">
          <condition attribute ="modifiedon" operator="between">
            <value>2017-03-10 18:40:00z</value>
            <value>2017-03-12 20:40:00z</value>
          </condition>
        </filter>
      </entity>
    </fetch>
    ```


Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Additional columns**: Add additional data columns to store source files' relative path or static value. Expression is supported for the latter. 

### Destination

Go to **Destination** tab to configure your copy activity destination. See the following content for the detailed configuration.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-dynamics-crm/destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing destination tab and the list of properties." :::

The following properties are **required**:

- **Data store type**: Select **External**.
- **Connection**: Select an existing Dynamics CRM connection from the connection list. If no connection exists, then create a new Dynamics CRM connection by selecting **New**.
- **Connection type**: Select **Dynamics CRM**.
- **Entity name**: Specify the name of the entity to write data. Select your entity name from the drop-down list, or select **Edit** to enter it manually. This is the logical name of the entity to retrieve.

Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Write behavior**: The write behavior of the operation. This property is required, and you must select **Upsert**. If you use **Add dynamic content**, specify the value to Upsert.
- **Alternate key name**: Specify the alternate key name defined on your entity to upsert records. 
- **Ignore null values**: Indicates whether to ignore null values from input data during write operation. It is unselected by default. 
    - When it is selected: Leave the data in the destination object unchanged when doing upsert/update operation, and insert defined default value when doing insert operation. 
    - When it is unselected: Update the data in the destination object to NULL when doing upsert/update operation, and insert NULL value when doing insert operation.
- **Write batch size**: Specify the row count of data written to Dynamics CRM in each batch. 
- **Max concurrent connections**: The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.

### Mapping

For **Mapping** tab configuration, go to [Configure your mappings under mapping tab](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab). 

### Settings

For the **Settings** tab configuration, go to [Configure your other settings under settings tab](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-other-settings-under-settings-tab).
