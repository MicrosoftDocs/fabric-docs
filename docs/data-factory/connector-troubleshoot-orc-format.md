# Troubleshoot the ORC format connector in Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the ORC format connector in Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric.

## Error code: OrcJavaInvocationException

- **Message**: `An error occurred when invoking Java, message: %javaException;.`

- **Cause**: If the error message contains the string `SQLSTATE=51002 SQLCODE=-805`, a required package is missing for the user.

- **Causes and recommendations**: Different causes can lead to this error. Check below list for possible cause analysis and related recommendation.

  | Cause analysis                                               | Recommendation                                               |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | When the error message contains the strings "java.lang.OutOfMemory," "Java heap space," and "doubleCapacity," it's usually a memory management issue in an old version of Data Factory runtime. | If you're using Self-hosted Integration Runtime, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version. |
  | When the error message contains the string "java.lang.OutOfMemory," the Data Factory runtime doesn't have enough resources to process the files. | Limit the concurrent runs on the Data Factory runtime. For Self-hosted IR, scale up to a powerful machine with memory equal to or larger than 8 GB. |
  |When the error message contains the string "NullPointerReference," the cause might be a transient error. | Retry the operation. If the problem persists, contact support. |
  | When the error message contains the string "BufferOverflowException," the cause might be a transient error. | Retry the operation. If the problem persists, contact support. |
  | When the error message contains the string "java.lang.ClassCastException:org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.HiveCharWritable can't be cast to org.apache.hadoop.io.Text," the cause might be a type conversion issue inside Java Runtime. Usually, it means that the source data can't be handled well in Java Runtime. | This is a data issue. Try to use a string instead of char or varchar in ORC format data. |

## Error code: OrcDateTimeExceedLimit

- **Message**: `The Ticks value '%ticks;' for the datetime column must be between valid datetime ticks range -621355968000000000 and 2534022144000000000.`

- **Cause**: If the datetime value is '0001-01-01 00:00:00', it could be caused by the differences between the [Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar#Difference_between_Julian_and_proleptic_Gregorian_calendar_dates).

- **Recommendation**:  Check the ticks value and avoid using the datetime value '0001-01-01 00:00:00'.
