# Quickstart: Create an Apache Airflow Job

> [!NOTE]
> Apache Airflow job is powered by Apache Airflow. </br> [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is an open-source platform used to programmatically create, schedule, and monitor complex jobs. It allows you to define a set of tasks, called operators, that can be combined into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent data pipelines.

Apache Airflow Job provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage Apache Airflow environments, enabling you to run your orchestration jobs at scale with ease. In this quickstart, let's create a simple Apache Airflow job to familiarize yourself with the environment and functionalities of Apache Airflow Job.

### Create an Apache Airflow Job

1. You can use an existing workspace or [Create a new workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md).

2. Expand `+ New` dropdown -> Click on More Options -> Under `Data Factory` section -> Select Apache Airflow Job

3. Give a suitable name to your project and click on the "Create" button.

### Create a DAG File

1. Click on "New DAG file" card -> give the name to the file and Click on "Create" button.

2. A boilerplate DAG code is presented to you. You can edit the file as per your requirements.

3. Click on "Save icon".

### Run a DAG

1. Begin by clicking on the "Run DAG" button.

2. Once initiated, a notification will promptly appear indicating the DAG is running.

3. To monitor the progress of the DAG run, simply click on "View Details" within the notification center. This action will redirect you to the Apache Airflow UI, where you can conveniently track the status and details of the DAG run.

### Monitor your Apache Airflow DAG in Apache Airflow UI

The saved dag files are loaded in the Apache Airflow UI. You can monitor them by clicking on the "Monitor in Apache Airflow" button.
