# Quickstart: Create an Apache Airflow Job

> [!NOTE]
> Apache Airflow job is powered by Apache Airflow.
>
>[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is an open-source platform used to programmatically create, schedule, and monitor complex jobs. It allows you to define a set of tasks, called operators, that can be combined into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent pipelines.

Apache Airflow Job provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage Apache Airflow environments, enabling you to run your orchestration jobs at scale with ease. In this quickstart, let's create a simple Apache Airflow job to familiarize yourself with the environment and functionalities of Apache Airflow Job.

## Create an Apache Airflow Job

1. You can use an existing workspace or [Create a new workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md).

1. Expand **+ New item** dropdown, then under the **Data Factory** section, select **Apache Airflow Job**

1. Give a suitable name to your project and select the **Create** button.

## Create a DAG File

1. Select the **New DAG file** card, give the name to the file, and select **Create**.

1. A boilerplate DAG code is presented to you. You can edit the file as per your requirements.

1. Select **Save**.

## Run a DAG

1. Begin by selecting the **Run DAG** button.

1. Once initiated, a notification appears indicating the DAG is running.

1. To monitor the progress of the DAG run, select **View Details** within the notification center. This action will redirect you to the Apache Airflow UI, where you can conveniently track the status and details of the DAG run.

## Monitor your Apache Airflow DAG in Apache Airflow UI

The saved dag files are loaded in the Apache Airflow UI. You can monitor them by clicking on the **Monitor in Apache Airflow** button.
