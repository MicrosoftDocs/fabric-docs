# Quickstart: Bring your Azure Data Factory to Fabric

In the quickstart, you learn how to bring your existing Azure Data Factory (ADF) to your Fabric workspace. This experience shows how you can easily bring your ADF in Microsoft Fabric and provides with a risk-free approach to try out your ADF pipelines in Microsoft Fabric before deciding to upgrade to Data Factory in Fabric.

- Enable the preview on your Microsoft Fabric tenant from the Fabric admin portal. Enable the Azure Data Factory preview using admin portal or reach out to your Fabric admin.
