# Set up your SharePoint Online List connection

This article outlines the steps to create a SharePoint Online List connection.

## Supported authentication types

The SharePoint Online List connector supports the following authentication types for copy and Dataflow Gen2 respectively.  

|Authentication type |Copy |Dataflow Gen2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Organizational account| √ | √|
|Service Principal| √ | √ |

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to a SharePoint Online List. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to a SharePoint Online List in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the SharePoint Online list connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric).
- To determine the URL to use to access your SharePoint Online list, go to [Determine the site URL](/power-query/connectors/sharepoint-online-list#determine-the-site-url).
- To connect to the Azure Blobs connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to a SharePoint Online list from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/sharepoint-online-list#connect-to-a-sharepoint-online-list-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.
