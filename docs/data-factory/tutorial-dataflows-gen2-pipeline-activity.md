# Use a dataflow in a pipeline

In this tutorial, you build a data pipeline to move OData from a Northwind source to a lakehouse destination and send an email notification when the pipeline is completed.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Make sure you have a [[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] enabled Workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md) that isn't the default My Workspace.

## Create a Lakehouse

To start, you first need to create a lakehouse. A lakehouse is a data lake that is optimized for analytics. In this tutorial, you create a lakehouse that's used as a destination for the dataflow.

1. Go to your Fabric enabled workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/go-to-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Fabric enabled workspace emphasized.":::

1. Select **Lakehouse** in the create menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/create-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create menu with Create Lakehouse emphasized." lightbox="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/create-lakehouse.png":::

1. Enter a **Name** for the lakehouse.
1. Select **Create**.

Now you've created a lakehouse and you can now set up the dataflow.

## Create a dataflow

A dataflow is a reusable data transformation that can be used in a pipeline. In this tutorial, you create a dataflow that gets data from an OData source and writes the data to a lakehouse destination.  

1. Go to your Fabric enabled workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/go-to-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Fabric enabled workspace.":::

1. Select **Dataflow Gen2** in the create menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/create-dataflow-gen2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Dataflow Gen2 selection under the new menu." lightbox="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/create-dataflow-gen2.png":::

1. Ingest the data from the OData source.

    1. Select **Get data**, and then select **More**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/get-data-more.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Get data menu with More emphasized.":::

    1. From **Choose data source**, search for **OData**, and then select the OData connector.

       :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/get-odata.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Get data menu with OData emphasized.":::

    1. Enter the **URL** of the OData source. For this tutorial, use the [OData sample service](https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/).
    1. Select **Next**.
    1. Select the **Entity** that you want to ingest. In this tutorial, use the **Orders** entity.

       :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/odata-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the OData preview." lightbox="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/odata-preview.png":::

    1. Select **Create**.

Now that you've ingested the data from the OData source, you can set up the lakehouse destination.

To ingest the data to the lakehouse destination:

1. Select **Add data destination**.
1. Select **Lakehouse**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/add-output-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add output destination menu with lakehouse emphasized.":::

1. Configure the connection you want to use to connect to the lakehouse. The default settings are fine.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Navigate to the workspace where you created the lakehouse.
1. Select the lakehouse that you created in the previous steps.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/select-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the selected lakehouse.":::

1. Confirm the table name.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Confirm the update method and select **Save settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/update-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the update methods, with replace selected.":::

1. Publish the dataflow.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When the first Dataflow Gen2 is created in a workspace, Lakehouse and Warehouse items are provisioned along with their related SQL analytics endpoint and semantic models. These items are shared by all dataflows in the workspace and are required for Dataflow Gen2 to operate, shouldn't be deleted, and aren't intended to be used directly by users. The items are an implementation detail of Dataflow Gen2. The items aren't visible in the workspace, but might be accessible in other experiences such as the Notebook, SQL-endpoint, Lakehouse, and Warehouse experiences. You can recognize the items by their prefix in the name. The prefix of the items is `DataflowsStaging'.

Now that you've ingested the data to the lakehouse destination, you can set up your data pipeline.

## Create a data pipeline

A data pipeline is a workflow that can be used to automate data processing. In this tutorial, you create a data pipeline that runs the Dataflow Gen2 that you created in the previous procedure.

1. Navigate back to the workspace overview page and select **Data Pipelines** in the create menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/create-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data Pipeline selection.":::

1. Provide a **Name** for the data pipeline.
1. Select the **Dataflow** activity.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/dataflow-pipeline-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dataflow activity emphasized.":::

1. Select the **Dataflow** that you created in the previous procedure in the **Dataflow** dropdown list under **Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/select-dataflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dataflow dropdown list.":::

1. Add an **Office 365 Outlook** activity.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/add-office365-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot emphasizing how to select an Office 365 Outlook activity.":::

1. Configure the **Office 365 Outlook** activity to send email notification.

    1. Authenticate with your Office 365 account.
    1. Select the **Email address** that you want to send the notification to.
    1. Enter a **Subject** for the email.
    1. Enter a **Body** for the email.

       :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/settings-email-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Office 365 Outlook activity settings." lightbox="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/settings-email-activity.png":::

## Run and schedule the data pipeline

In this section, you run and schedule the data pipeline. This schedule allows you to run the data pipeline on a schedule.

1. Go to your workspace.
1. Open the dropdown menu of the data pipeline that you created in the previous procedure, and then select **Schedule**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/schedule-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pipeline menu with schedule emphasized.":::

1. In **Scheduled run**, select **On**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/setting-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of scheduled run set to On." lightbox="media/tutorial-dataflows-gen2-pipeline-activity/setting-schedule.png":::

1. Provide the schedule you want to use to run the data pipeline.

    1. Repeat, for example, every **Day** or every **Minute**.
    1. When selected Daily, you can also select the **Time**.
    1. Start **On** a specific **Date**.
    1. End **On** a specific **Date**.
    1. Select the **Timezone**.

1. Select **Apply** to apply the changes.

You've now created a data pipeline that runs on a schedule, refreshes the data in the lakehouse, and sends you an email notification. You can check the status of the data pipeline by going to the **Monitor Hub**. You can also check the status of the data pipeline by going to **Data Pipeline** and selecting the **Run history** tab in the dropdown menu.
