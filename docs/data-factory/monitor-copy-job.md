# Learn how to monitor a Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

After you execute a Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric, you can monitor its progress and metrics through either the Copy job panel or the Monitoring hub. The Monitoring hub acts as a centralized portal for reviewing Copy job runs across various items.

## Monitor in the Copy job panel

After you initiate a Copy job, you can immediately track its progress and metrics. The display consistently shows data from the most recent runs, reporting on the following metrics.

- Status
- Row read
- Row written
- Throughput

You can also see a list of the items being copied in the job, with the following individual table metrics reported:

- Source table name
- Destination table name
- Status
- Rows read
- Rows written
- Duration
- Run start
- Run stop
- Throughput

- When you select the **View run history** button on the Copy job panel Results area to view the recent runs for your job, you can select **Go to Monitor**:
