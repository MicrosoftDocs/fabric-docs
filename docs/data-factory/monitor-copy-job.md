# Monitor a Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

After you run a Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric, you can monitor its progress and metrics through either the [Copy job panel](#monitor-in-the-copy-job-panel) or the [Monitoring hub](#monitor-in-the-monitoring-hub) in Data Factory. The Monitoring hub gives you one place to check on all your Copy job runs.

## Monitor in the Copy job panel

After you initiate a Copy job, you can immediately track its progress and metrics in its job panel. The display shows data from the most recent runs, reporting on the following metrics:

- **Status**: The current state or final outcome of the job run (for example, succeeded, failed, or in progress).
- **Rows read**: The total number of rows read from the source during the job run.
- **Rows written**: The total number of rows written to the destination during the job run.
- **Throughput**: The average data movement rate achieved during the job run.

>[!TIP]
>Select **More** to view the Copy Job Run ID, which can be used to create a support ticket, if needed.

You can also see a list of the items being copied in the job, with the following individual table metrics reported for each item:

- **Source and destination names**: The source system and the target system involved in the data movement.
- **Status**: The current state or final outcome of the run (for example, succeeded, failed, or in progress).
- **Rows read**: The total number of rows read from the source during the run.
- **Rows written**: The total number of rows written to the destination during the run.
- **Files read**: The number of files read from the source during the run.
- **Files written**: The number of files written to the destination during the run.
- **Data read**: The total volume of data read from the source during the run.
- **Data written**: The total volume of data written to the destination during the run.
- **Duration**: The total time taken to complete the run.
- **Run start**: The timestamp when the run started.
- **Run stop**: The timestamp when the run completed or stopped.
- **Throughput**: The average data movement rate achieved during the run.
- **Load type**: Indicates whether the run performed a full copy or an incremental copy.
- **Lower bound (incremental copy only)**: The starting watermark value used to identify incremental changes.
- **Upper bound (incremental copy only)**: The ending watermark value used to identify incremental changes.
- **Rows inserted (Fabric Lakehouse as destination only)**: The number of new rows inserted into the Fabric Lakehouse during the run.
- **Rows updated (Fabric Lakehouse as destination only)**: The number of existing rows updated in the Fabric Lakehouse during the run.
- **Rows deleted (Fabric Lakehouse as destination only)**: The number of rows deleted from the Fabric Lakehouse during the run.
- **Run ID**: A unique identifier assigned to the run for tracking and troubleshooting purposes for each item.

>[!NOTE]
>The **Rows Read** and **Rows Written** columns show the total number of new rows that were inserted, deleted, or updated in the source. For a Fabric Lakehouse source, each update generates two rows—one representing the previous value and one representing the updated value. For example, since the last read, if 1 row was updated 5 times, the total would be 10 rows from Fabric Lakehouse source.

## Monitor in the Monitoring hub

The Monitoring hub is your go-to place for checking on all your Copy job runs. You can get there in two ways:

- On the main Fabric navigation pane on the left of the Fabric site, select **Monitor**.

- Select the **View run history** button in the Copy job panel and select **Go to Monitor**:

Either of these links bring you to the Monitoring hub, where you can see a list of all Copy jobs and their runs:
