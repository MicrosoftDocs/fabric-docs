# Move queries from Dataflow Gen1 to Dataflow Gen2

Dataflow Gen2 is the new generation of dataflows. However, many existing dataflows were created over the years using the original version of dataflows (now called *Dataflow Gen1* and listed as the **Dataflow** type in your workspace). This article describes three methods for migrating your older Dataflow Gen1 dataflows into Dataflow Gen2 (CI/CD): importing Dataflow Gen1 dataflows into Dataflow Gen2 using the export template feature, copy the Gen1 queries and paste them into a new Dataflow Gen2, or using the Save As feature for saving an existing Dataflow Gen1 as a new Dataflow Gen2 (CI/CD).

## Use the export template feature

Use the export template feature if you're aiming to copy all queries in a dataflow, or all queries from another PowerQuery host such as Power Platform Dataflow or Excel Workbook.  

To use the export template feature:

1. From your Power BI or Data Factory workspace, select the ellipsis next to an existing Dataflow Gen1 and then select **Edit**.

1. In the **Home** tab of the Power Query editor, select **Export template**.

1. In **Export template**, enter the name you want to call this template in **Name**. Optionally, you can add a description for this template in **Description**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/export-template-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Export template dialog box, with Contoso Sample 48 entered in Name.":::

1. Select **OK** to save the template. The template is saved in your default Downloads folder.

1. From your Data Factory workspace, select **New item**, and then select **Dataflow Gen2**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/new-dataflow-gen2.png" alt-text="Screenshot with the New menu opened with Dataflow Gen2 emphasized." lightbox="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/new-dataflow-gen2.png":::

1. From the current view pane of the Power Query editor, select **Import from a Power Query template**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/import-from-power-query-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the current view with Import from a Power Query template emphasized." lightbox="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/import-from-power-query-template.png":::

1. In the **Open** dialog box, browse to your default Downloads folder and select the .pqt file you saved in the previous steps. The select **Open**.

1. The template is then imported to your Dataflow Gen2. You might be required to enter your credentials at this time. If so, select **Configure connection** and enter your credentials. Then select **Connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/configure-your-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Power Query editor with Configure connection emphasized." lightbox="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/configure-your-connection.png":::

Your Dataflow Gen1 is now imported to Dataflow Gen2.

## Copy and paste existing Dataflow Gen1 queries

Use the copy existing Dataflow Gen1 queries if you're aiming to copy only a subset of your queries.

To copy existing Dataflow Gen1 queries:

1. From your Power BI or Data Factory workspace, select the ellipsis next to an existing Dataflow Gen1 and then select **Edit**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/edit-dataflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workspace where you choose to edit the dataflow." lightbox="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/edit-dataflow.png":::

1. In Power Query, select the query or queries you want to copy. If there are multiple queries or folders (called _groups_ in Power Query) you want to copy, select **Ctrl** as you select the queries or folders you want to copy. Then either select Ctrl+C or right-click in the selection and select **Copy**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/copy-queries.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Power Query workspace with the Contoso Financial Sample query selected and the copy option emphasized.":::

1. Open an existing Dataflow Gen2, or create a new Dataflow Gen2 in Data Factory. To create a new dataflow, open an existing workflow and select **New item** > **Dataflow Gen2**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/new-dataflow-gen2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the New menu opened with Dataflow Gen2 emphasized.":::

1. In the Power Query editor, select **Get data** > **Blank query**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/select-blank-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Get data menu opened with Blank query emphasized.":::

1. In the **Blank query** dialog box, select **Next**.

1. Select inside the **Queries** pane of the Power Query editor, and then select **Ctrl+V** to paste the query.

1. You might need to add your credentials before you can use the pasted queries. If a `Credentials are required to connect to the Web source.` message appears, select **Configure connection**, and then enter your credentials.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/configure-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the credentials error message and configure credentials button." lightbox="./media/move-dataflow-gen1-to-dataflow-gen2/configure-connection.png":::

1. Select **Connect** to connect to your data.

1. Once you connect to your data, right-click the initial blank query, and then select **Delete** to remove the empty query.

## Save an existing Dataflow Gen1 As a new Dataflow Gen2 (CI/CD)

Use the Save As feature if you’re aiming to upgrade an entire Dataflow Gen1 to Dataflow Gen2 (CI/CD), including its settings (for more information, go to [Known limitations](migrate-to-dataflow-gen2-using-save-as.md#known-limitations)) and queries.  

To use the Save As feature:
