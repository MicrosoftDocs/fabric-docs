# Send Teams messages with the Teams activity

The Teams activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric lets you send messages to Teams channels or group chats. You can customize messages with dynamic expressions to include information from your pipeline.

## Prerequisites

* A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
* A workspace.

## Add Teams activity to a pipeline

To integrate Teams messaging into your pipeline, you need to add the Teams activity. This section guides you through the steps to include and configure the Teams activity in your pipeline.

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. In the **Activities** pane, search for Teams and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

For details about the **General** settings tab, see [General settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings).

## Configure Teams activity settings

Set up the Teams activity by following these steps:

1. Add a connection to your Teams activity. You can create a new connection or use an existing one.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * If you're using user authentication and deploying the pipeline with the Teams activity to another workspace, the activity will be inactive until you create a new user authentication connection in the target workspace.
    > * If you don't have access to the connections used in the Teams activity, the target environment will set those activities to inactive. After that you can edit the target pipeline, change the authorization, and set the activity to active.

   :::image type="content" source="media/teams-activity/connect-to-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Settings tab of the Teams activity highlighting where to create a new connection or use an existing connection.":::

1. Choose where to post the message using the **Post in** setting. You can post to a channel or a group chat.

1. If you select group chat, use the dropdown to pick a group chat you're part of. If you select channel, choose a team and then a channel from the dropdowns.

1. Write your message in the **Message** area. Use [dynamic expressions](expression-language.md) to include system or user variables, expressions, or functions. Select **View in expression builder** to add dynamic expressions.

1. If you're posting to a channel, you can add a subject for the message in the **Subject** text box.
