# Binary format for Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric

This article outlines how to configure Binary format in Data Factory.

## Supported capabilities

Binary format is supported for the following activities and connectors as source and destination.

| Category | Connector/Activity |
|---|---|
| **Supported connector** | [Amazon S3](connector-amazon-s3-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Amazon S3 Compatible](connector-amazon-s3-compatible-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Blob Storage](connector-azure-blob-storage-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Files](connector-azure-files-copy-activity.md)|
|  | File system |
|  | [FTP](connector-ftp-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Google Cloud Storage](connector-google-cloud-storage-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [HTTP](connector-http-copy-activity.md)|
|  | [Lakehouse Files](connector-lakehouse-copy-activity.md)|
|  | [Oracle Cloud Storage](connector-oracle-cloud-storage-copy-activity.md)|
|  | [SFTP](connector-sftp-copy-activity.md) |
| **Supported activity** | [Copy activity](copy-data-activity.md) (source/destination) |
|  | [GetMetadata activity](get-metadata-activity.md) |
|  | [Delete activity](delete-data-activity.md) |

## Binary format in copy activity

To configure Binary format, choose your connection in the source or destination of the pipeline copy activity, and then select **Binary** in the drop-down list of **File format**. Select **Settings** for further configuration of this format.

>[!Note]
> When using Binary format in a copy activity, source and destination should both use Binary format.

### Binary as source

After you select **Settings** in the **File format** section under the **Source** tab, the following properties are displayed in the pop-up **File format settings** dialog box.

:::image type="content" source="./media/format-binary/file-format-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing file format settings.":::

- **Compression type**: The compression codec used to read binary files.
You can choose from the **None**, **bzip2**, **gzip**, **deflate**, **ZipDeflate**, **TarGzip**, or **tar** type in the drop-down list.

  If you select **ZipDeflate** as the compression type, **Preserve zip file name as folder** is displayed under the **Advanced** settings in the **Source** tab.

  - **Preserve zip file name as folder**: Indicates whether to preserve the source zip file name as a folder structure during copy.
    - If this box is checked (default), the service writes unzipped files to `<specified file path>/<folder named as source zip file>/`.
    - If this box is unchecked, the service writes unzipped files directly to `<specified file path>`. Make sure you don't have duplicated file names in different source zip files to avoid racing or unexpected behavior.

  If you select **TarGzip/tar** as the compression type, **Preserve compression file name as folder** is displayed under the **Advanced** settings in the **Source** tab.

  - **Preserve compression file name as folder**: Indicates whether to preserve the source compressed file name as a folder structure during copy.
    - If this box is checked (default), the service writes decompressed files to `<specified file path>/<folder named as source compressed file>/`.
    - If this box is unchecked, the service writes decompressed files directly to `<specified file path>`. Make sure you don't have duplicated file names in different source zip files to avoid racing or unexpected behavior.

- **Compression level**: The compression ratio. You can choose from **Optimal** or **Fastest**.

  - **Fastest**: The compression operation should complete as quickly as possible, even if the resulting file isn't optimally compressed.
  - **Optimal**: The compression operation should be optimally compressed, even if the operation takes a longer time to complete. For more information, go to the[Compression Level](/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.compressionlevel) article.

Under **Advanced** settings in the **Source** tab, further Binary format related property are displayed.

- **Delete files after completion**: Indicates whether the binary files are deleted from the source store after successfully moving to the destination store. The file deletion is per file. So when a copy activity fails, some files have already been copied to the destination and deleted from the source, while others still remain on the source store.

### Binary as destination

After you select **Settings** in the **File format** section under the **Destination** tab, following properties are displayed in the pop-up **File format settings** dialog box.

:::image type="content" source="./media/format-binary/file-format-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selecting file format.":::

- **Compression type**: The compression codec used to write binary files.
You can choose from the **None**, **bzip2**, **gzip**, **deflate**, **ZipDeflate**, **TarGzip** or **tar** type in the drop-down list.

- **Compression level**: The compression ratio. You can choose from **Optimal** or **Fastest**.

  - **Fastest**: The compression operation should complete as quickly as possible, even if the resulting file isn't optimally compressed.
  - **Optimal**: The compression operation should be optimally compressed, even if the operation takes a longer time to complete. For more information, go to the [Compression Level](/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.compressionlevel) article.
