# Learn how to create a Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

This article describes how to use the Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric.

## Prerequisites

- Enable the Copy job feature in your tenant.

  1. Select **Apply**.

## Create a Copy job

Complete the following steps to create a new Copy job:

1. [Create a new workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md) or use an existing workspace.
1. Select **+ New Item**, and then choose the **Copy job** icon to create a new Copy job.

1. Choose the data stores to copy data from.

1. Once you enter your credentials to connect to source stores, select the tables and columns you wish to copy.

1. Configure table or column mapping if you need.

1. Choose the copy mode, either a one-time full data copy, or continuous incremental copying.

   > [!NOTE]
   > - When you choose incremental copy mode, Data Factory _initially_ performs a full load and subsequently carries out incremental copies in subsequent runs.
   > - The **Incremental column** is specific to the incremental copy mode. This column in your source data helps identify changes. Each time, the Copy job saves the value from this column as a watermark, only copying rows where the **Incremental column** value exceeds the previous one.

1. Review the job summary and save it.

   :::image type="content" source="media/copy-job/review-save.png" lightbox="media/copy-job/review-save.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to review and save the newly created Copy job.":::

1. In the Copy job panel, you can modify, execute, and track the job's status. The inline monitoring panel displays row counts read/written for the latest runs only. Select **Monitor run history** to view these metrics for past runs.

1. You can also see the data availability in the data destination.

## Known limitations

- Monitor button isn't available yet to see the aggregated read/written row counts per table and database in Copy job life-cycle.
- Incremental copy mode can't work with some data stores including Fabric Lakehouse as source yet. These will come soon.
- Row deletion can't be captured from source store.
- When copying files to storage locations, empty files will be created at the destination if no data is loaded from the source.
