# Concept: Data pipeline Runs

A data pipeline run occurs when a data pipeline is executed. This means that the activities in your data pipeline ran and were executed to completion. For example, running a data pipeline with a **Copy data** activity performs that action and copy your data. Each data pipeline run has its own unique pipeline run ID.

A data pipeline run can be triggered one of two ways, either on-demand or by setting up a schedule. A scheduled pipeline is able to run based on the time and frequency that you set.

## On-demand data pipeline run

To manually trigger a data pipeline run, select **Run** found in the top banner of the **Home** tab.

You are prompted to save your changes before triggering the pipeline run. Select **Save and run** to continue.

After your changes are saved, your pipeline will run. You can view the progress of the run in the **Output** tab found at the bottom of the canvas.

Once an activity completes in a run, a green check mark appears in the corner of the activity.

Once the entire pipeline executes and the output status updates to **Succeeded**, you have a successful pipeline run!

## Scheduled data pipeline runs

When you schedule a data pipeline run, you can choose the frequency that your pipeline runs. Select **Schedule**, found in the top banner of the **Home** tab, to view your options. By default, your data pipeline isn't set on a schedule.

> [!TIP]
> when scheduling a data pipeline, the interface requires specifying both a start and an end date. This design ensures that all scheduled pipelines have a defined execution period.  Currently, there's no built-in option to set a schedule without an end date.
> To maintain an ongoing schedule, you can set the end date far into the future, such as several years ahead. for example **2099-01-01** This approach effectively keeps the pipeline running indefinitely, allowing you to manage or adjust the schedule as needed over time.



On the Schedule configuration page, you can specify a schedule frequency, start and end dates and times, and time zone.

Once configured, select **Apply** to set your schedule. You can view or edit the schedule again anytime by selecting the **Schedule** button again.
