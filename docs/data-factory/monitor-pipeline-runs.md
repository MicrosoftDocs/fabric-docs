# How to monitor data pipeline runs in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]

In this how-to guide, you'll learn the different ways to review and monitor your pipeline runs.

[!INCLUDE [df-preview-warning](includes/data-factory-preview-warning.md)]

## Monitor data pipeline runs

1. To monitor your data pipeline runs, hover over your pipeline in your workspace. Doing so will bring up three dots to the right of your pipeline name.

2. Select the three dots to find a list of options. Then select **View run history**. This action opens a fly-out on the right side of your screen with all your recent runs and run statuses.

3. Select one of your pipeline runs to view detailed information. Youâ€™ll be able to view what your pipeline looks like and view more properties like Run ID or errors if your pipeline run failed.

   :::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/view-recent-run-additional-details-updated.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/view-recent-run-additional-details-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recent run details.":::

4. To find additional information on your pipeline runs **Input** and **Output**, hover over an activity row and select either the **Input** or **Output** icon. Details will be shown in a pop-up.

[//]: # (:::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/view-performance-details.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/view-performance-details.png"  alt-text="Screenshot showing glasses icon.":::)

[//]: # (:::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/performance-details.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/performance-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copy data details screen.":::)

[//]: # (More details can be found under **Duration breakdown** and **Advanced**.)

[//]: # (:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/copy-data-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of additional details for copy data run.":::)

5. If your data pipeline failed, view the error message by hovering over the activity row and select the message icon under **Status**. This selection will bring up error details, such as the error code and message.

   :::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/failed-pipeline-updated.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/failed-pipeline-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where the failed status appears.":::

   :::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/error-details-updated.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/error-details-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot of error details.":::

6. Select **Update pipeline** to make changes to your pipeline. This selection will land you back in the pipeline canvas.

7. You can also **Rerun** your data pipeline. You can choose to rerun the entire pipeline or only rerun the pipeline from the failed activity.  

   :::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/rerun-updated.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/rerun-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Rerun.":::

   :::image type="content" lightbox="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/rerun-menu-updated-1.png" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/rerun-menu-updated-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Rerun menu options.":::

## Gantt view

A Gantt chart is a view that lets you see the run history over a time range. If you switch to a Gantt view, all pipeline runs will be grouped by name, displayed as bars relative to how long the run took.

The length of the bar relates to the duration of the pipeline. You can select the bar to view more details.
