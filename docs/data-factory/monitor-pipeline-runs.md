# How to monitor pipeline runs in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]

This guide walks you through ways to check in on your pipeline runs, or monitor your pipeline runs. Whether you're just curious about how things are going or need to troubleshoot something specific, we’ll show you how to track progress, spot issues early, and make sure everything’s running smoothly. Monitoring helps you stay in control so that you can catch problems before they grow and keep your workflows on track.

## Monitor pipeline runs

1. To monitor your pipeline runs, hover over your pipeline in your workspace. Doing so brings up three dots to the right of your pipeline name.

2. Select the three dots to find a list of options. Then select **View run history**. This action opens a fly-out on the right side of your screen with all your recent runs and run statuses.

3. Select **Go to monitoring hub** from the prior screenshot to view more details and filter results. Use the filter to find specific pipeline runs based on several criteria.

4. Select one of your pipeline runs to view detailed information. You're able to view what your pipeline looks like and view more properties like Run ID or errors if your pipeline run failed.

5. If you have greater than 2000 activity runs in your pipelines, select **Load more** to see more results in the same monitoring page.

7. Use the **Filter** to filter by activity status or **Column Options** to edit the columns viewed in the monitoring view.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/column-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of column options.":::

   You can also search for an activity name, activity type, or activity run ID with the **Filter by keyword** box.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/filter-by-keyword-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of keyword filtering results.":::

7. If you want to export your monitoring data, select **Export to CSV**.

8. To find additional information on your pipeline runs **Input** and **Output**, select the input or output links to the right of the relevant row in the Activity Runs.

9. You can select **Update pipeline** to make changes to your pipeline from this screen. This selection takes you back to the pipeline canvas.

10. You can also **Rerun** your pipeline. You can choose to rerun the entire pipeline or only rerun the pipeline from the failed activity.  

11. To view performance details, select an activity from the list of **Activity Runs**. Performance details pop up.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-pipeline-runs/performance-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copy data details screen.":::

   More details can be found under **Duration breakdown** and **Advanced**.

## Gantt view

Switching to the Gantt view gives you a clear, visual way to track your pipeline runs over time. Each run shows up as a bar, grouped by pipeline name, and the length of the bar shows how long the run took. It’s a great way to spot patterns, compare durations, and quickly see what’s running when. This view makes monitoring easier so that you can catch delays, overlaps, or anything unusual at a glance.

The length of the bar relates to the duration of the pipeline. You can select the bar to view more details.
