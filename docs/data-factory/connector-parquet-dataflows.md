# Connect to Parquet files in dataflows

You can connect to Parquet files in Dataflow Gen2 using the Parquet connector provided by Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to Parquet files. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to Parquet files in Dataflow Gen2:

* To get started using the Parquet connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric).
* To connect to the Parquet connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to a Parquet file from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/parquet#connect-to-a-parquet-file-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.
