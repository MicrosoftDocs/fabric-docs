# Quickstart: Create your first pipeline to copy data

In this quickstart, you'll build a pipeline that moves a sample dataset into a Lakehouse. It's a simple way to see how pipeline copy activities work and how to load data into a Lakehouse.

>[!TIP]
>You can also use a [Copy job](quickstart-copy-job.md) to move data from one place to another. Check out [this decision guide](../fundamentals/decision-guide-pipeline-dataflow-spark.md) to help you pick the right tool.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following setup:

- A [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] tenant account with an active subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- Make sure you have a [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] enabled Workspace: [Create a workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md).

## Create a pipeline

1. Go to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/).
1. Select the Power BI icon in the lower left, then choose **Fabric** to open the Microsoft Fabric homepage.

1. Go to your [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] workspace. If you made a new workspace as a prerequisite, use that one.

1. Select **New item**, search for, and pick **Pipeline**, and enter a name for your pipeline.

## Copy data with your pipeline

1. In your pipeline, select **Copy data assistant**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/copy-data-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copy data button.":::


1. Choose the **Sample data** tab at the top of the data source browser page, then select the **Public Holidays** sample data, and then **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Choose data source page of the Copy data assistant with the Public Holidays sample data selected.":::

1. On the **Connect to data source** page of the assistant, the preview for the **Public Holidays** sample data is displayed, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/sample-data-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sample data for the Public Holidays sample data.":::

1. To configure your destination, select **Lakehouse**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/lakehouse-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of the Lakehouse destination in the Copy data assistant.":::

1. Enter a Lakehouse name, then select **Create and connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/create-new-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the specified name for the new Lakehouse.":::

1. Configure and map your source data to the destination Lakehouse table. Select **Tables** for the **Root folder** and **Load to new table** for **Load settings**. Provide a **Table** name and select **Next**.

1. Review your copy activity settings, then select **Save + run** to finish. You can go back and change any settings if you need to. If you just want to save your pipeline without running it right away, clear the **Start data transfer immediately** checkbox.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/review-create-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review + create page of the Copy data assistant highlighting source and destination.":::

1. The Copy activity now appears in your pipeline. When you select the **Copy data** activity, you'll see all its settings—including advanced options—in the tabs below the canvas.

## Run and schedule your pipeline

1. If you didn't choose to **Save + run** on the **Review + save** page of the **Copy data assistant**, switch to the **Home** tab and select **Run**. A confirmation dialog is displayed. Then select **Save and run** to start the activity.

1. You can watch your pipeline run and see the results on the **Output** tab below the canvas. To check the details, select the activity name in the output list.

1. The run details page shows how much data your pipeline read and wrote, along with other helpful info about the run.

1. You can set your pipeline to run on a schedule. For example, select **Schedule** to open the scheduling options, then pick how often you want it to run—for example, every 15 minutes.
