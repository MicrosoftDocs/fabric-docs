# Tutorial: Practice with a sample dbt project in Microsoft Fabric

The dbt Job in Microsoft Fabric lets you run dbt transformations without complex setup. You can orchestrate model builds, tests, and deployments directly in Fabric using built-in capabilities for scheduling and monitoring. This tutorial walks you through working with a sample project to learn dbt job capabilities.

In this tutorial, you:

> * Run dbt transformations
> * Monitor and verify the results

If you don't have a Fabric subscription, create a [free trial account](https://aka.ms/fabric-trial).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you need:

- Access to a Microsoft Fabric workspace
- Permissions to create items in the workspace
- Basic familiarity with dbt concepts (models, tests, and transformations)

## Create a dbt job with a sample project

Create a new dbt job item in your workspace using sample project files.

1. Go to your Fabric workspace.
1. Select **+New item**, then search for and select **dbt job** from the item creation menu.
1. Enter a name, select a location, and select **Create**.

1. You see three options for starting a dbt project. Select **Practice with Sample Project** to explore and work with a prebuilt example.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/landing-page-with-three-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing three options to start a dbt project.":::

1. Select the Jaffle Shop sample project, which lets you work with data that includes orders, payments, and customer datasets.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/jaffle-shop.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Jaffle Shop sample project option.":::

1. Select **Select a profile** to select an adapter profile to run your dbt project against.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/select-profile-jaffle-shop.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the profile selection for the Jaffle Shop project.":::

1. Create a new warehouse to store your sample data by selecting the **Warehouse** option.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/select-warehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Fabric warehouse selection.":::

1. Enter a name for the warehouse and select **Create and connect**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/name-a-warehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the warehouse naming dialog.":::

1. By default, the schema is set to jaffle_shop, and the option to seed data is selected. This loads sample data into the schema inside the warehouse you created. Select **Connect**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/jaffle-shop-schema.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Jaffle Shop schema and seed data options.":::

1. The project setup completes in a few minutes as the files are imported. After it finishes, verify that the sample data was seeded  selecting the **Open Warehouse** button at the top of the page, and checking the warehouse and schema. You can also confirm the sample data in the output panel at the bottom of the screen.

## Run the dbt job

Execute the dbt transformations to build models, run tests, and create snapshots.

1. The top panel provides options to Build, Compile, or Run your project. By default, the operation is set to Build, which runs all models, tests, and snapshots together for a complete workflow.

1. Select **Build**, then select **Run**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/build-run-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Build command and Run command buttons.":::

1. (Optional) You can run or exclude specific models using advanced selectors. Go to **Advanced Settings** in the top panel, select **Run Settings**, and then select **Run with Advanced Selectors**.

    ```bash
    dbt run --select my_model 
    dbt build --select staging.* 
    dbt build --exclude deprecated_models 
    ```

    Selectors let you target parts of your pipeline for faster iteration during development or testing.

## Monitor and verify the results

Review the execution results and verify that transformations completed successfully.

1. After the dbt job starts, you can monitor its progress in the Output tab at the bottom of the screen. The run typically completes in a few minutes.

1. Confirm a successful run by checking the Output tab. The status shows as succeeded when the run completes successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/run-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a successful build command execution.":::

1. Verify the output by checking the transformed data in the Fabric Warehouse by selecting the **Open Warehouse** button at the top of the dbt job page, then looking under the sample_dbt_project → jaffle_shop schema.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/fabric-dw-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the transformed data in the Fabric warehouse.":::

1. Open the **Compiled SQL** tab at the bottom of the dbt job page to review the rendered SQL code that dbt ran. This tab helps you debug issues or optimize queries.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/compiled-sql.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the compiled SQL in the bottom panel.":::

1. Open the **Lineage view** to visualize the dependency graph of your models. This view shows how data flows between sources and transformations, helping you understand relationships, assess downstream impact, and troubleshoot issues.

## Clean up resources

After completing the tutorial, you can delete the dbt job and warehouse to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.

1. Open the Fabric workspace where you created the dbt job.
1. Hover over the dbt job you created, select the **More options** ellipsis (...), and then select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dbt-job/delete-dbt-job.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the more options menu to delete the dbt job from your workspace.":::

1. To delete the warehouse, search for the warehouse in the workspace where you created your dbt job, hover over the warehouse you created, select the **More options** ellipsis (...), and then select **Delete**.
