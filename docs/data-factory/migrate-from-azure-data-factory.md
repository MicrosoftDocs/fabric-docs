# Migrate from Azure Data Factory to Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric

This guide is for Azure Data Factory and Synapse Gen2 pipeline creators. It explains how to modernize and migrate your pipelines to Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric.

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric is a unified platform for self-service and IT-managed enterprise data. It supports scalable, secure, and accessible solutions for organizations of all sizes.

Data Factory in Fabric offers advanced features and capabilities, enabling data integration developers to consolidate their solutions within Fabric. This guide answers common questions about migrating to Fabric pipelines, including:

- What features are available in Fabric pipelines?
- How do Fabric pipelines differ from Azure Data Factory?
- How do you migrate existing pipelines?

> [!NOTE]
> The decision to migrate depends on your specific requirements. Evaluate the benefits carefully to make an informed choice. Currently, there are no plans to deprecate Azure Data Factory or Synapse Gen2 for data ingestion. However, Fabric pipelines are the focus for enterprise data ingestion.

## Enterprise and self-service data integration

Fabric simplifies discovery, collaboration, and management by bringing resources together. Central IT teams can operationalize data movement and transformation services while integrating self-service tools. Key features include:

- Office 365 and Teams activities for communication.
- Seamless Power BI model refreshes.
- Governance tools for data lineage and monitoring.
- Generative AI with Copilot for intelligent pipeline creation and error resolution.

This shared platform streamlines workflows, helping organizations scale their data solutions efficiently.

## Fabric capacities

Fabric's distributed architecture handles high loads, spikes, and concurrency effectively. Larger Fabric capacity SKUs offer better performance and throughput.

## Feature comparison

Hereâ€™s a comparison of features in Azure Data Factory and Fabric Data Factory:

| Feature | Azure Data Factory | Fabric Data Factory |

| **Platform scalability and resiliency** |||
| [Premium capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md) for increased scale and performance | No | Yes |
| [Multi-Geo](../admin/service-admin-premium-multi-geo.md) support for regional and organizational data residency needs | Yes | Yes |
| **Security** |||
| [Virtual network (VNet)](/data-integration/vnet/overview) connectivity for seamless integration | No | Yes |
| [On-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem) for secure access to on-premises data | No | Yes |

| [Audit log](../admin/track-user-activities.md) to track user activities across Fabric and Microsoft 365 | No | Yes |

<sup>1</sup> Use the [Get metadata](get-metadata-activity.md), [Until](until-activity.md), and [If condition](if-condition-activity.md) activities for equivalent metadata retrieval of the Validation activity.

<sup>2</sup> Use the Invoke remote pipeline function to execute mapping data flow activities. See the [Invoke Pipeline activity](invoke-pipeline-activity.md).

<sup>3</sup> For supported connectors, see [Pipeline support](pipeline-support.md).

<sup>4</sup> Use Fabric eventstreams and Reflex to trigger execution run events. See [Pipeline event triggers](pipeline-storage-event-triggers.md).

## Considerations

There are some other considerations to factor into your planning before migrating to Fabric pipelines.

### Licensing

Fabric pipelines require at least a Microsoft Fabric (Free) license to author in a premium capacity workspace. Learn more in [Fabric licenses](../enterprise/licenses.md).

### Roadmap

For updates and planned features, see the [Microsoft Fabric release plan documentation](/fabric/release-plan).
