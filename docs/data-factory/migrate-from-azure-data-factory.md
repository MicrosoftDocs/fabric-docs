# Migrate from Azure Data Factory to Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric

This article targets Azure Data Factory and Synapse Gen2 pipeline creators. It provides you with guidance and rationale to help modernize and migrate your pipelines to Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric.

## Background

Microsoft Fabric is an integrated platform for both self-service and IT-managed enterprise data. With exponential growth in data volumes and complexity, Fabric customers demand enterprise solutions that scale, are secure, easy to manage, and accessible to all users across the largest of organizations.

In recent years, Microsoft invested significant work to deliver scalable cloud capabilities to customers. To that end, Data Factory in Fabric empowers a large ecosystem of data integration developers and data integration solutions built up over decades to use the full set of features, and capabilities that go far beyond comparable functionality available in previous generations.

Naturally, customers are asking whether there's an opportunity to consolidate by hosting their data integration solutions within Fabric. They often ask questions like:

- Does all the functionality we depend on work in Fabric pipelines?
- What capabilities are available only in Fabric pipelines?
- How do we migrate existing pipelines to Fabric pipelines?
- What's Microsoft's roadmap for enterprise data ingestion?

Answers to many of these questions are described in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> The decision to migrate to Fabric capacities depends on the requirements of each customer. Customers should carefully evaluate other benefits in order to make an informed decision. We expect to see organic migration to Fabric pipelines over time, and our intention is that it happens on terms that each customer is comfortable with.
> 
> To be clear, currently there aren't any plans to deprecate Azure Data Factory or Synapse Gen2 for data ingestion. There's a priority to focus investment on Fabric pipelines for enterprise data ingestion, and so the extra value provided by Fabric capacities will increase over time. Customers who choose Fabric capacities can expect to benefit from alignment with the Microsoft Fabric product roadmap.

### Convergence of enterprise and self-service data integration

The consolidation of items in Fabric simplifies discovery, collaboration, and management by colocating resources. This allows central IT teams to operationalize mission-critical data movement and transformation services aligned with corporate standards, including data lineage and monitoring, while more easily integrating popular self-service items.

To support the collaborative and scalable needs of organizations, Fabric pipelines introduce Office 365 and Teams activities for sending messages, seamless refreshes of Power BI semantic models, and robust governance features, helping organizations manage data lineage and pipeline monitoring. The integration of generative AI via Copilot further enhances the pipeline experience by offering intelligent pipeline generation and error resolution explanations, simplifying the creation and management of complex solutions.

By utilizing a common platform, the workflow is streamlined, enhancing solution development between business and IT. This empowers organizations to scale their data solutions to enterprise levels, ensuring high performance, flexibility, and efficiency in managing vast amounts of data.

### Fabric capacities

Due to its distributed architecture, Fabric capacities are less sensitive to overall load, temporal spikes, and high concurrency. By consolidating capacities to larger Fabric capacity SKUs, customers can achieve increased performance and throughput.

<sup>2</sup> Use the Invoke remote pipeline function to execute the mapping data flow activities, refer to the [Invoke Pipeline activity](invoke-pipeline-activity.md).

<sup>3</sup> To view the connectors that are currently supported for data pipelines, refer to [Pipeline support](pipeline-support.md).

<sup>4</sup> Use Fabric eventstreams and Reflex to trigger execution run events, refer to [Pipeline event triggers](pipeline-storage-event-triggers.md).

## Considerations

There are some other considerations to factor into your planning before migrating to Fabric pipelines.

### Licensing

Fabric pipelines require at minimum a Microsoft Fabric (Free) license to author in a premium capacity workspace, to learn more refer to [Fabric licenses](../enterprise/licenses.md).

### Roadmap

The Microsoft Fabric release plan documentation announces the latest updates and timelines to customers as features are prepared for future releases, including what's new and planned for Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric.
