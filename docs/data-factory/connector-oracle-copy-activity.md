# Configure Oracle in a copy activity

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in data pipeline to copy data from and to Oracle.

## Supported configuration

For the configuration of each tab under copy activity, go to the following sections respectively.

- [General](#general)  
- [Source](#source)
- [Destination](#destination)
- [Mapping](#mapping)
- [Settings](#settings)

### General

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Source

The following properties are supported for Oracle under the **Source** tab of a copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/oracle-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the source tab and the list of properties." lightbox="./media/connector-oracle/oracle-source.png":::

The following properties are **required**:

- **Connection**:  Select an Oracle connection from the connection list. If no connection exists, then create a new Oracle connection by selecting **More** at the bottom of the connection list.
- **Use query**: Select from **Table** or **Query**.
    - If you select **Table**:
      - **Table**: Specify the name of the table in the Oracle to read data. Select the table from the drop-down list or select **Enter manually** to enter the schema and table name.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/use-query-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Use query - Table." :::

    - If you select **Query**:
      - **Query**: Specify the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `SELECT * FROM MyTable`.
        
        When you enable partitioned load, you need to hook any corresponding built-in partition parameters in your query. For examples, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/use-query-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Use query - Query." :::

Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Partition option**: Specifies the data partitioning options used to load data from Oracle. When a partition option is enabled (that is, not **None**), the degree of parallelism to concurrently load data from an Oracle database is controlled by **Degree of copy parallelism** in copy activity settings tab.

    If you select **None**, you choose not to use partition.

    If you select **Physical partitions of table**:
    - **Partition names**: Specify the list of physical partitions that needs to be copied.

        If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?DfTabularPartitionName` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/physical-partitions-of-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the configuration when you select Physical partitions of table." lightbox="./media/connector-oracle/physical-partitions-of-table.png":::

    If you select **Dynamic range**:
    - **Partition column name**: Specify the name of the source column in **integer type** that will be used by range partitioning for parallel copy. If not specified, the primary key of the table is auto-detected and used as the partition column.

      If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?DfRangePartitionColumnName` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section.

    - **Partition upper bound**: Specify maximum value of the partition column to copy data out.

      If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?DfRangePartitionUpbound` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the Parallel copy from [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section.

    - **Partition lower bound**: Specify the minimum value of the partition column to copy data out.
  
      If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?DfRangePartitionLowbound` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the Parallel copy from [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/dynamic-range.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the configuration when you select Dynamic range." lightbox="./media/connector-oracle/dynamic-range.png":::

- **Query timeout (minutes)**: Specify the timeout for query command execution, default is 120 minutes. If a parameter is set for this property, allowed values are timespan, such as "02:00:00" (120 minutes).

- **Additional columns**: Add additional data columns to store source files' relative path or static value. Expression is supported for the latter.

### Destination

The following properties are supported for Oracle under the **Destination** tab of a copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/oracle-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing destination tab." lightbox="./media/connector-oracle/oracle-destination.png":::

The following properties are **required**:

- **Connection:** Select an Oracle connection from the connection list. If the connection doesn't exist, then create a new Oracle connection by selecting **More** at the bottom of the connection list.
- **Table**: Select the table in your database from the drop-down list. Or check **Enter manually** to enter the schema and table name.

Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Pre-copy script**: Specify a SQL query for the copy activity to execute before you write data into Oracle in each run. You can use this property to clean up the preloaded data.
- **Write batch timeout**: The wait time for the batch insert operation to complete before it times out. The allowed value is timespan. An example is 00:30:00 (30 minutes).
- **Write batch size**: Specify the number of rows to insert into the Oracle table per batch. The allowed value is integer (number of rows). By default, the service dynamically determines the appropriate batch size based on the row size. The default value is 10,000.
- **Max concurrent connections**: The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.

### Mapping

For **Mapping** tab configuration, go to [Configure your mappings under mapping tab](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab).

### Settings

For **Settings** tab configuration, see [Configure your other settings under settings tab](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-other-settings-under-settings-tab).

## Parallel copy from Oracle

The Oracle connector provides built-in data partitioning to copy data from Oracle in parallel. You can find data partitioning options on the **Source** tab of the copy activity.

When you enable partitioned copy, the service runs parallel queries against your Oracle source to load data by partitions. The parallel degree is controlled by the **Degree of copy parallelism** setting in the copy activity settings tab. For example, if you set **Degree of copy parallelism** to four, the service concurrently generates and runs four queries based on your specified partition option and settings, and each query retrieves a portion of data from your Oracle database.

You are suggested to enable parallel copy with data partitioning especially when you load large amount of data from your Oracle database. The following are suggested configurations for different scenarios. When copying data into file-based data store, it's recommanded to write to a folder as multiple files (only specify folder name), in which case the performance is better than writing to a single file.

| Scenario                                                     | Suggested settings                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full load from large table, with physical partitions.        | **Partition option**: Physical partitions of table. <br><br/>During execution, the service automatically detects the physical partitions, and copies data by partitions. |
| Full load from large table, without physical partitions, while with an integer column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data. If not specified, the primary key column is used.|
|Load a large amount of data by using a custom query, with physical partitions. | **Partition options**: Physical partitions of table.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> PARTITION("?DfTabularPartitionName") WHERE <your_additional_where_clause>`. <br><br>**Partition name**: Specify the partition name(s) to copy data from. If not specified, the service automatically detects the physical partitions on the table you specified in the Oracle data. <br>During execution, the service replaces `?DfTabularPartitionName` with the actual partition name, and sends to Oracle.|
| Load a large amount of data by using a custom query, without physical partitions, while with an integer column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE ?DfRangePartitionColumnName <= ?DfRangePartitionUpbound AND ?DfRangePartitionColumnName >= ?DfRangePartitionLowbound AND <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data. You can partition against the column with integer data type.<br>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound**: Specify if you want to filter against partition column to retrieve data only between the lower and upper range.<br><br>During execution, the service replaces `?DfRangePartitionColumnName`, `?DfRangePartitionUpbound`, and `?DfRangePartitionLowbound` with the actual column name and value ranges for each partition, and sends to Oracle. <br>For example, if your partition column "ID" is set with the lower bound as 1 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy set as 4, the service retrieves data by 4 partitions. Their IDs are between [1,20], [21, 40], [41, 60], and [61, 80], respectively.`|

> [!TIP]
> When copying data from a non-partitioned table, you can use "Dynamic range" partition option to partition against an integer column. If your source data doesn't have such type of column, you can leverage [ORA_HASH]( https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/functions136.htm) function in source query to generate a column and use it as partition column.
