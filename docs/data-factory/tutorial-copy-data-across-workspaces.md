# Copy data across workspaces

In this tutorial, you learn how to copy data across workspaces. This experience shows you a quick demo about copying data from a Lakehouse in one workspace to a Lakehouse in another workspace using a data pipeline. 

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Fabric enabled workspaces. If you don't already have them, refer to the article [Create a workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md).
- **Lakehouse**. You use the Lakehouse in different workspaces as the source and destination data stores. If you don't have them, see [Create a Lakehouse](../data-engineering/create-lakehouse.md) for instructions on how to set one up in different workspaces.

## Create a pipeline 

1. Switch to the **Data Factory** experience.

1. Select **New** and then **Pipeline**, and then input a name for your pipeline.

## Copy data across workspaces using a data pipeline

You can copy data across workspaces either directly through the UI or by using parameters in a data pipeline. This section focuses on how to connect to the destination Lakehouse located in different workspaces. For details on how to use copy activity in a data pipeline and how to configure Lakehouse in a copy activity, go to [Add a copy activity directly](copy-data-activity.md#add-a-copy-activity-directly) and [Configure Lakehouse in a copy activity](connector-lakehouse-copy-activity.md). 

### Option 1: Through UI

1. In the source configuration for copy activity in the data pipeline, select your source Lakehouse and the data that you want to copy, and configure the source properties.
1. In the destination configuration, go to the connection drop-down list to browse to all connections.

1. On the **OneLake catalog** tab, select **Explorer** and choose the workspace where your destionation Lakehouse is located. Then select the Lakehouse.

    In the pop-up connect to data source page, select an existing connection or create a new Lakehouse connection from the drop-down list.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use copy assitant, on choose data source/destination page, you can also utilize this step to connect to your destination Lakehouse.

1. Configure other destination properties and run your pipeline.


### Option 2: Using parameters

1. In the source configuration for your copy activity in the data pipeline, select your source Lakehouse and the data you want to copy, and configure the source properties.

1. In the destination configuration, follow [Configure parameters in a copy activity](copy-data-activity.md#configure-parameters-in-a-copy-activity) to add parameter for your destination Lakehouse connection. If you need to create a new connection, follow the step 3 in this [section](#option-1-through-ui).
1. Specify the destination workspace ID and Lakehouse ID after specifying the expression.

1. Configure other destination properties and run your pipeline.
