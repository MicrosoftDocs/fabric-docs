# What’s Azure Data Factory Item?

Azure Data Factory Item (Mount) lets you effortlessly bring your existing Azure Data Factory into a Fabric workspace. It’s like opening a live view of your ADF pipelines right inside Fabric—without having to migrate or rebuild anything. It’s a low-risk way to start using Fabric while keeping your ADF setup just the way it is.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- Permissions: You’ll need contributor access to the ADF and member/admin rights in the Fabric workspace.
- Same Tenant: Your ADF and Fabric workspace must be in the same Azure AD tenant.
- Same Region (Recommended): For best performance, keep your Fabric workspace in the same region as your ADF.

## What’s new?
You can now manage, view, and edit those pipelines directly from the Fabric portal. It’s the same ADF that is now accessible inside your Fabric workspace.

## What stays the same
Your pipelines, dataflows, triggers, integration runtimes, and schedules all keep running in ADF. No long migration times and nothing gets altered.

## Authoring pipelines
You can edit pipelines in Fabric’s Data Factory UI—it looks and feels like the ADF portal.
Prefer your Git-based workflow? No problem. Fabric will show the published version of your pipelines, but your Git setup stays intact.

## Running pipelines
Pipelines still run on ADF’s infrastructure. That means:
- Same integration runtimes (including Self-Hosted IRs).
- Same compute and billing (you’re charged by Azure for ADF, not Fabric capacities).
- No need to set up a Fabric gateway for existing pipelines.

## Monitoring & admin
- You can trigger and debug pipelines as well as perform basic monitoring in Fabric. For full monitoring (like viewing past runs or setting alerts), head back to the ADF portal.
- Some features like global parameters aren’t visible in Fabric.

## Why use Azure Data Factory Item?
- It’s a great way to explore Fabric without disrupting your current ADF setup.
- You get a unified workspace—view dashboards, run pipelines, and manage data all in one place.
- It supports gradual migration and modernization. You can keep your ADF pipelines running while starting to build new things in Fabric.

## How to mount your Azure Data Factory: 
There are two entry points, one from ADF and one within Fabric workspace.
### 1. Mount from Fabric workspace
1.  Go to your Fabric workspace.
1.	Create New Item > Azure Data Factory.
