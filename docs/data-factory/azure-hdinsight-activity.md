# Transform data by running an Azure HDInsight activity

The Azure HDInsight activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to orchestrate the following Azure HDInsight job types:

- Execute Hive queries
- Invoke a MapReduce program
- Execute Pig queries
- Execute a Spark program
- Execute a Hadoop Stream program

This article provides a step-by-step walkthrough that describes how to create an Azure HDInsight activity using the Data Factory interface.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add an Azure HDInsight (HDI) activity to a pipeline with UI

1. Create a new data pipeline in your workspace.
1. Select the **Pipeline activity** card, or select the **Activities** tab, and select Azure HDInsight.

   - Creating the activity from the home screen card:

   - Creating the activity from the Activities bar:

1. Select the new Azure HDInsight activity on the pipeline editor canvas if it isn't already selected.

   Refer to the [General settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the options found in the **General settings** tab.

## Configure the HDI cluster

1. Select the **HDI Cluster** tab. Then you can choose an existing or create a new **HDInsight connection**.
1. For the **Resource connection**, choose the Azure Blob Storage that references your Azure HDInsight cluster. You can choose an existing Blob store or create a new one.

## Configure settings

Select the **Settings** tab to see the advanced settings for the activity.

All advanced cluster properties and dynamic expressions supported in the [Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics HDInsight linked service](/azure/data-factory/compute-linked-services#azure-hdinsight-linked-service) are now also supported in the Azure HDInsight activity for Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric, under the **Advanced** section in the UI. These properties all support easy-to-use custom parameterized expressions with dynamic content.

### Cluster type

To configure settings for your HDInsight cluster, first choose its **Type** from the available options, including [_Hive_](#hive), [_Map Reduce_](#map-reduce), [_Pig_](#pig), [_Spark_](#spark), and [_Streaming_](#streaming).

#### Hive

If you choose _Hive_ for **Type**, the activity executes a Hive query. You can optionally specify the **Script connection** referencing a storage account that holds the Hive type. By default, the storage connection you specified in the **HDI Cluster** tab are used. You need to specify the **File path** to be executed on Azure HDInsight. Optionally, you can specify more configurations in the **Advanced** section, **Debug information**, **Query timeout**, **Arguments**, **Parameters**, and **Variables**.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-hdinsight-activity/hive-cluster-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the cluster type of Hive.":::

#### Map Reduce

If you choose _Map Reduce_ for **Type**, the activity invokes a Map Reduce program. You can optionally specify in the Jar connection referencing a storage account that holds the Map Reduce type. By default, the storage connection you specified in the HDI Cluster tab is used. You need to specify the **Class name** and **File path** to be executed on Azure HDInsight. Optionally you can specify more configuration details, such as importing Jar libraries, debug information, arguments, and parameters under the **Advanced** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-hdinsight-activity/map-reduce-cluster-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of Map Reduce for the HDInsight cluster type.":::

#### Pig

If you choose _Pig_ for **Type**, the activity invokes a Pig query. You can optionally specify the **Script connection** setting that references the storage account that holds the Pig type. By default, the storage connection that you specified in the HDI Cluster tab is used. You need to specify the **File path** to be executed on Azure HDInsight. Optionally you can specify more configurations, such as debug information, arguments, parameters, and variables under the **Advanced** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-hdinsight-activity/pig-cluster-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of the Pig type for the HDInsight cluster.":::

#### Spark

If you choose _Spark_ for **Type**, the activity invokes a Spark program. Select either _Script_ or _Jar_ for the **Spark type**. You can optionally specify the **Job connection** referencing the storage account that holds the Spark type. By default, the storage connection you specified in the HDI Cluster tab is used. You need to specify the **File path** to be executed on Azure HDInsight. Optionally you can specify more configurations, such as class name, proxy user, debug information, arguments, and spark configuration under the Advanced section.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-hdinsight-activity/spark-cluster-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of the Spark type for the HDInsight cluster.":::

#### Streaming

If you choose _Streaming_ for **Type**, the activity invokes a Streaming program. Specify the **Mapper** and **Reducer** names, and you can optionally specify the **File connection** referencing the storage account that holds the Streaming type. By default, the storage connection that you specified in the HDI Cluster tab is used. You need to specify the **File path for Mapper** and **File path for Reducer** to be executed on Azure HDInsight. Include the **Input** and **Output** options as well for the WASB path. Optionally you can specify more configurations, such as debug information, arguments, and parameters under the Advanced section.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the Home tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
