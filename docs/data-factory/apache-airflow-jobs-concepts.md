# What is Apache Airflow Job?

> [!NOTE]
> Apache Airflow job is powered by [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

Apache Airflow job is the next generation of Azure Data Factory's Workflow Orchestration Manager.
It makes it easy to create and manage [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) jobs, so you can run Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) at scale without hassle.  As part of Microsoft Fabric's Data Factory, it gives you a modern way to bring in, prepare, and transform data from all kinds of data sources — like databases, data warehouses, Lakehouse, real-time data, and more.

## When to use Apache Airflow job?

Apache Airflow jobs give you a managed service where you can build and run Python-based DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for workflow orchestration, without worrying about the setup behind the scenes. If you like working with Apache Airflow or prefer writing code, this option is a great fit. If you’d rather not write code, data pipelines offer a simple, no-code way to handle data orchestration.

## Key Features

Microsoft Fabric's hosted Apache Airflow job comes with a variety of helpful features, including:
