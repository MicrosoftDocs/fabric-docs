# What is Apache Airflow Job?

> [!NOTE]
> Apache Airflow job is powered by [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

Apache Airflow job is the next generation of Azure Data Factory's Workflow Orchestration Manager.
It's a simple and efficient way to create and manage [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) orchestration jobs, enabling you to run Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) at scale with ease.  It's the part of Fabric's Data Factory that empowers you with a modern data integration experience to ingest, prepare and transform data from a rich set of data sources for example, databases, data warehouse, Lakehouse, real-time data, and more.

## When to use Apache Airflow job?

Apache Airflow jobs offers a managed service that enables users to create and manage Python-based DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for workflow orchestration, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. If you have experience with Apache Airflow or you prefer code-centric approach, this option is ideal. In contrast, if you prefer a no-code solution for data orchestration, data pipelines offer a user-friendly alternative that doesnâ€™t require managing or writing Python-based workflows.
