# Access Apache Airflow Job Logs

> [!NOTE]
> Apache Airflow job is powered by [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

This article shows you how to access Apache Airflow job logs through the Apache Airflow Job UI. 

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Create or use an existing workspace in Microsoft Fabric.

- [Create or use an existing Apache Airflow job in Microsoft Fabric.](../data-factory/create-apache-airflow-jobs.md)

### Create and Run the Apache Airflow Job

We use default Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which is automatically created when a new file is added to Dags folder of Fabric managed storage.

1. Create a new file in Dags folder. A Dag is initialized consisting of BashOperator that prints "Hello world" in Apache Airflow Job logs.

2. Save and Run the DAG within the Apache Airflow UI.

### Access logs of Apache Airflow Job

1. When the DAG runs, its logs are displayed in the results section. Click on Arrow, to expand the results section.
