# Set up your Access database connection

This article outlines the steps to create an Access database connection.

## Supported authentication types

The Access database connector supports the following authentication types for copy and Dataflow Gen2 respectively.  

|Authentication type |Copy |Dataflow Gen2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Organizational account| n/a | âˆš |

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to an Access database. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to an Access database in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the Access database connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric-preview).
- Be sure to install or set up any [Access database prerequisites](/power-query/connectors/access-database#prerequisites) before connecting to the Access database connector.
- To connect to the Access database connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to Access database from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/access-database#connect-to-an-access-database-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.

## Set up your connection in a data pipeline

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric doesn't currently support Access database in data pipelines.
