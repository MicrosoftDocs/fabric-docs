# Use the Dataflow activity to run a Dataflow Gen2

The Dataflow activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to run a Dataflow Gen2.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add a Dataflow activity to a pipeline with UI

To use a Dataflow activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Creating the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for Dataflow in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

1. Select the new Dataflow activity on the canvas if it isn't already selected.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Dataflow activity settings

Select the **Settings** tab, then select an existing workspace and dataflow to run. If you have made a [Dataflow Gen2 with CI/CD and Git integration support (Preview)](dataflow-gen2-cicd-and-git-integration.md), you can also select it from the dropdown.

The notification option is not currently available.

>[!NOTE]
>Public parameters mode and support for parameters to be passed to a Dataflow is a preview feature only available for Dataflow Gen2 with CI/CD support.

Inside the Dataflow parameters section you are able to enter the name of the parameter that you wish to pass as well as the type and value that you wish to pass.

For more information on how to enable the Dataflow parameters capability on your Dataflow Gen2, check the article on [Public parameters for Dataflow Gen2](dataflow-parameters.md).

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
