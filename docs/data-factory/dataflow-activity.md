# Use the Dataflow activity to run a Dataflow Gen2

The Dataflow activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to run a Dataflow Gen2.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add a Dataflow activity to a pipeline with UI

To use a Dataflow activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Creating the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for Dataflow in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

1. Select the new Dataflow activity on the canvas if it isn't already selected.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Dataflow activity settings

Select the **Settings** tab, then select an existing workspace and dataflow to run. If you have made a [Dataflow Gen2 with CI/CD and Git integration support (Preview)](dataflow-gen2-cicd-and-git-integration.md), you can also select it from the dropdown.

The notification option is disabled for now, but the feature is coming soon.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
