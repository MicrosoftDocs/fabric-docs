# SQL database connector overview (Preview)

SQL database in Microsoft Fabric is a developer-friendly transactional database, based on [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview), that allows you to easily create your operational database in Fabric. A SQL database in Fabric uses the same SQL Database Engine as Azure SQL Database. For more information, see this [article](/fabric/database/sql/overview).
