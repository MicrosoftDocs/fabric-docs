# Preprocess data with a stored procedure before loading into Lakehouse

In this tutorial, we show you how to use a pipeline Script activity to run a stored procedure to create a table and preprocess the data in a Synapse Data Warehouse. After that, we load the preprocessed table into Lakehouse.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Fabric enabled workspace. If you don't already have one, refer to the article [Create a workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md).
- Prepare a stored procedure in your Azure Synapse Data Warehouse. Create the following stored procedure in advance:
  
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE spM_add_names
  AS
  --Create initial table
  IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects
  WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[names]') AND TYPE IN (N'U'))
  BEGIN
  DROP TABLE names
  END;

  CREATE TABLE names
  (id INT,fullname VARCHAR(50));

  --Populate data
  INSERT INTO names VALUES (1,'John Smith');
  INSERT INTO names VALUES (2,'James Dean');

  --Alter table for new columns
  ALTER TABLE names
  ADD first_name VARCHAR(50) NULL;

  ALTER TABLE names
  ADD last_name VARCHAR(50) NULL;

  --Update table
  UPDATE names
  SET first_name = SUBSTRING(fullname, 1, CHARINDEX(' ', fullname)-1);

  UPDATE names
  SET last_name = SUBSTRING(fullname, CHARINDEX(' ', fullname)+1, LEN(fullname)-CHARINDEX(' ', fullname));

  --View Result
  SELECT * FROM names;
  ```

## Create a pipeline Script activity to run the stored procedure

In this section, we use a Script activity to run the stored procedure created in the prerequisites.

1. Choose a **Script** activity from the **Activities** toolbar and then select the settings tab in the properties pane to choose the connection details. Select the **Connection** dropdown there to choose **More**. Then you can connect to your Azure Synapse Data Warehouse.

1. Select **Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL DW)** under the **New sources** section.

1. Provide your **Server**, **Database**, and **Username** and **Password** fields for **Basic authentication**, and enter SynapseConnection for the **Connection name**. Then select **Create** to create the new connection.

1. Input **EXEC spM_add_names** to run the stored procedure. It creates a new table dbo.name and preprocess the data with a simple transformation to change the **fullname** field into two fields, **first_name** and **last_name**.

## Use a pipeline activity to load preprocessed table data into Lakehouse

1. Select **Copy data** from the **Activities** toolbar and then select **Use copy assistant**, or use the **Copy data assistant** card on the pipeline landing page, to start the **Copy data assistant**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-pre-process-data-with-stored-procedure-load-into-lakehouse/use-copy-assistant.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Use copy assistant button under Copy data.":::

1. Enter _Synapse_ in the search filter and select **Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL DW)** for  data source, and then select **Next**.

1. Choose the existing connection **SynapseConnection** that you created previously.

1. Choose the table **dbo.names** that was created and preprocessed by the stored procedure. Then select **Next**.

1. Select **Lakehouse**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/lakehouse-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of Lakehouse for the copy destination in the Copy assistant.":::

1. Enter a name then select **Create and connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data/create-new-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the New Lakehouse dialog.":::

1. Input a destination table name for the data to be copied into for the Lakehouse destination and select **Next**.
