# Delimited text format in Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]

This article outlines how to configure delimited text format in the data pipeline of Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

## Supported capabilities

Delimited text format is supported for the following activities and connectors as source and destination.

| Category | Connector/Activity | 
|---|---|
| **Supported connector** |[Amazon S3](connector-amazon-s3-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Blob Storage](connector-azure-blob-storage-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1-copy-activity.md) |
|  | [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-copy-activity.md)|
|  | [Google Cloud Storage](connector-google-cloud-storage-copy-activity.md) | 
|  | [HTTP](connector-http-copy-activity.md)| 
| **Supported activity** | [Copy activity](copy-data-activity.md) |
|  | [Lookup activity](lookup-activity.md) |
|  | [GetMetadata activity](get-metadata-activity.md) |
|  | [Delete activity](delete-data-activity.md) | 

## Delimited text format in copy activity

To configure delimited text format, choose your connection in the source or destination of data pipeline copy activity, and then select **DelimitedText** in the drop-down list of **File format**. Select **Settings** for further configuration of this format.

### Delimited text format as source 

After selecting **Settings** in **File format** section, following properties are shown up in the pop-up **File format settings** dialog box.

:::image type="content" source="./media/format-delimited-text/file-format-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing source file format settings.":::

- **Compression type**: The compression codec used to read delimited text files.
You can choose from **None**, **bzip2**, **gzip**, **deflate**, **ZipDeflate**, **TarGzip** or **tar** type in the drop-down list.

    If you select **ZipDeflate** as compression type, **Preserve zip file name as folder** will show up under **Advanced** settings in **Source** tab.

    - **Preserve zip file name as folder**: Indicates whether to preserve the source zip file name as folder structure during copy.
        - If this box is checked (default), the service writes unzipped files to `<specified file path>/<folder named as source zip file>/`.
        - If this box is unchecked, the service writes unzipped files directly to `<specified file path>`. Make sure you don't have duplicated file names in different source zip files to avoid racing or unexpected behavior.

    If you select **TarGzip/tar** as compression type, **Preserve compression file name as folder** will show up under **Advanced** settings in **Source** tab.
    
    - **Preserve compression file name as folder**: Indicates whether to preserve the source compressed file name as folder structure during copy.
        - If this box is checked (default), the service writes decompressed files to `<specified file path>/<folder named as source compressed file>/`.
        - If this box is unchecked, the service writes decompressed files directly to `<specified file path>`. Make sure you don't have duplicated file names in different source zip files to avoid racing or unexpected behavior.
    
- **Compression level**: Specify the compression ratio when you select a compression type. You can choose from **Optimal** or **Fastest**.

    - **Fastest**: The compression operation should complete as quickly as possible, even if the resulting file is not optimally compressed.
    - **Optimal**: The compression operation should be optimally compressed, even if the operation takes a longer time to complete. For more information, see [Compression Level topic](/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.compressionlevel).
- **Column delimiter**: The character(s) used to separate columns in a file. The default value is **comma** (`,`).

- **Row delimiter**: Specify the character used to separate rows in a file. Only one character is allowed. The default value is line feed `\n`.

- **Encoding**: The encoding type used to read/write test files. The default value is **UTF-8**.

- **Escape character**: The single character to escape quotes inside a quoted value. The default value is **backslash** `\`. When escape character is defined as empty string, the **Quote character** must be set as empty string as well, in which case make sure all column values don't contain delimiters.

- **Quote character**: The single character to quote column values if it contains column delimiter. The default value is **double quotes** `"`. When **Quote character** is defined as empty string, it means there is no quote char and column value is not quoted, and escape character is used to escape the column delimiter and itself.

- **First row as header**: Specifies whether to treat/make the first row as a header line with names of columns. Allowed values are selected and unselected (default). When first row as header is unselected, note UI data preview and lookup activity output auto generate column names as Prop_{n} (starting from 0), copy activity requires [explicit mapping](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping#explicit-mapping) from source to destination and locates columns by ordinal (starting from 1).

- **Null value**: Specifies the string representation of null value. The default value is empty string.

Under **Advanced** settings in **Source** tab, other delimited text format related properties are exposed.

### Delimited text format as destination

After selecting **Settings** in **File format** section, following properties are shown up in the pop-up **File format settings** dialog box.

- **Null value**: Specifies the string representation of null value. The default value is empty string.

Under **Advanced** settings in **Destination** tab, further delimited text format related property are shown up.

- **Quote all text**: Enclose all values in quotes.

- **File extension**: The file extension used to name the output files, for example, `.csv`, `.txt`. 

- **Max rows per file**: When writing data into a folder, you can choose to write to multiple files and specify the max rows per file.

- **File name prefix**: Applicable when **Max rows per file** is configured. Specify the file name prefix when writing data to multiple files, resulted in this pattern: `<fileNamePrefix>_00000.<fileExtension>`. If not specified, file name prefix will be auto generated. This property does not apply when source is file based store or partition option enabled data store.
