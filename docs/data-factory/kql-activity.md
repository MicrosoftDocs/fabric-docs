# Use the KQL activity to run a query

The KQL activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to run a query in Kusto Query Language (KQL) against an Azure Data Explorer instance.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add a KQL activity to a pipeline with UI

To use a KQL activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Creating the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for KQL in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may need to expand the menu and scroll down to see the KQL activity as highlighted in the screenshot below.

1. Select the new KQL activity on the pipeline editor canvas if it isn't already selected.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### KQL activity settings

1. Select the **Settings** tab, and then select your **KQL Database** connection from the dropdown, or create a new one. If you select a workspace data store you can use dynamic content to parameterize the database selection by selecting the **Add dynamic content** option that appears in the dropdown.

1. Then provide a KQL query to execute against the selected database for the **Command** property. You can use dynamic content in the query by selecting the **Add dynamic content** link that appears when the text box is selected.

1. Finally, specify a command timeout or leave the default timeout of 20 minutes. You can use dynamic content for this property too.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

The KQL activity might typically be used with other activities. After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
