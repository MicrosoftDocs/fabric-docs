# Configure SharePoint Online List in a copy activity

This article shows you how to use the copy activity in a data pipeline to copy data from SharePoint Online List.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to set up service principal authentication to connect to SharePoint. Here's how to do it:

1. On your SharePoint tenant, disable DisableCustomAppAuthentication through PowerShell:  

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell
   Connect-SPOService -Url https://<your-domain>-admin.sharepoint.com
   Set-SPOTenant -DisableCustomAppAuthentication $false
   Disconnect-SPOService
   ```

1. Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform. To learn how, go to [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

   Make note of these values - you'll use them to define the connection:
   - Application ID
   - Application key
   - Tenant ID

1. Grant SharePoint Online site permission to your registered application. You'll need a site admin role for this step.

   1. Open a SharePoint Online site link, for example `https://[your_site_url]/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx` (replace the site URL).
   1. Search for the application ID you registered, fill in the empty fields, and then select **Create**.

      Use these values:
      - **App Domain**: `contoso.com`
      - **Redirect URL**: `https://www.contoso.com`
      - **Permission Request XML**:

        ```xml
        <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
            <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web" Right="Read"/>
        </AppPermissionRequests>
        ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > When you configure the SharePoint connector, the **App Domain** and **Redirect URL** refer to the SharePoint app that you registered in Microsoft Entra ID to allow access to your SharePoint data.
      >
      > The **App Domain** is the domain where your SharePoint site is hosted. For example, if your SharePoint site is at `https://contoso.sharepoint.com`, then the **App Domain** would be `contoso.sharepoint.com`.
      >
      > The **Redirect URL** is the URL that the SharePoint app redirects to after the user authenticates and grants permissions to the app. This URL should be a page on your SharePoint site that the app has permission to access. For example, you could use the URL of a page that displays a list of files in a library, or a page that displays the contents of a document.

   1. Select **Trust It** for this app.

## Configuration options

You can configure each tab under a copy activity. Go to the following sections for details about each tab:

- [General](#general)  
- [Source](#source)
- [Mapping](#mapping)
- [Settings](#settings)

### General

For **General** tab configuration, see our [General settings overview](activity-overview.md#general-settings).

### Source

The SharePoint Online List source supports the following properties under the **Source** tab of a copy activity.

**Required properties:**

- **Connection**: Select a SharePoint Online List connection from the connection list. If no connection exists, create a new HTTP connection by selecting **Browse all**, then **SharePoint Online List**, and following the [connection guide](connector-sharepoint-online-list.md) to fill out the details.
- **Use query**: Choose either **List name** or **Query** as your use query. Here's how to configure each setting:

  - **List name**: The name of the SharePoint Online list.

  - **Query**: The OData query to filter the data in SharePoint Online list. For example, `"$top=1"`.

**Advanced options:**

Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Request timeout**: The wait time to get a response from SharePoint Online. Default value is 5 minutes (00:05:00).
- **Additional columns**: Add other data columns to store source files' relative path or static value. Expression is supported for the latter.
