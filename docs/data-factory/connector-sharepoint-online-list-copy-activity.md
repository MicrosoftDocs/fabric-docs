# Configure SharePoint Online List in a Copy activity

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in a data pipeline to copy data from SharePoint Online List.

## Prerequisites

1. The SharePoint List Online connector uses service principal authentication to connect to SharePoint. Follow these steps to set it up:
1. On your SharePoint tenant, disable DisableCustomAppAuthentication through PowerShell.  

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell`  
   Connect-SPOService -Url https://<your-domain>-admin.sharepoint.com`  
   Set-SPOTenant -DisableCustomAppAuthentication $false`  
   Disconnect-SPOService
   ```

1. Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform. To learn how, go to [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app). Make note of these values, which you use to define the connection:

   - Application ID
   - Application key
   - Tenant ID

1. Use the following steps to grant SharePoint Online site permission to your registered application. To grant permission, you need a site admin role.

   1. Open a SharePoint Online site link, for example `https://[your_site_url]/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx` (replace the site URL).
   2. Search the application ID you registered, fill the empty fields, and then select **Create**.

      - App Domain: `contoso.com`
      - Redirect URL: `https://www.contoso.com`
      - Permission Request XML:

        ```xml
        <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
            <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web" Right="Read"/>
        </AppPermissionRequests>
        ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > In the context of configuring the SharePoint connector, the **App Domain** and **Redirect URL** refer to the SharePoint app that you've registered in Microsoft Entra ID to allow access to your SharePoint data. The **App Domain** is the domain where your SharePoint site is hosted. For example, if your SharePoint site is located at `https://contoso.sharepoint.com`, then the **App Domain** would be `contoso.sharepoint.com`. The **Redirect URL** is the URL that the SharePoint app redirects to after the user has authenticated and granted permissions to the app. This URL should be a page on your SharePoint site that the app has permission to access. For example, you could use the URL of a page that displays a list of files in a library, or a page that displays the contents of a document.

   3. Select **Trust It** for this app.
