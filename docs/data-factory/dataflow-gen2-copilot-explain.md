The Copilot explainer skill in Dataflow Gen2 is an AI-powered assistant within Microsoft Fabric's Data Factory workload that helps you interpret Mashup (Power Query M) code in natural language.

The experience allows you to explain the full query or a particular step of a query:

* **Explain this query**: you can trigger this experience via the Copilot pane or via right-clicking your queries through the Queries pane and selecting the option to *Explain* or *Describe*.
