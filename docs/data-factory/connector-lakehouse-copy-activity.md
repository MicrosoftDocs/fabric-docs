# Configure Lakehouse in a copy activity

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in a data pipeline to copy data from and to the Fabric Lakehouse. By default, data is written to Lakehouse Table in V-Order, and you can go to [Delta Lake table optimization and V-Order](../data-engineering/delta-optimization-and-v-order.md#what-is-v-order) for more information.

## Supported format

Lakehouse supports the following file formats. Refer to each article for format-based settings.

- [Avro format](format-avro.md)
- [Binary format](format-binary.md)
- [Delimited text format](format-delimited-text.md)
- [Excel format](format-excel.md)
- [JSON format](format-json.md)
- [ORC format](format-orc.md)
- [Parquet format](format-parquet.md)
- [XML format](format-xml.md)

## Supported configuration

For the configuration of each tab under copy activity, go to the following sections respectively.

- [General](#general)  
- [Source](#source)
- [Destination](#destination)
- [Mapping](#mapping)
- [Settings](#settings)

### General

For the **General** tab configuration, go to [General](activity-overview.md#general-settings).

### Source

The following properties are supported for Lakehouse under the **Source** tab of a copy activity.

    - Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:
      - **Table actions**: Specify the operation against the selected table.
        - **Append**: Append new values to existing table.
          - **Enable Partition**: This selection allows you to create partitions in a folder structure based on one or multiple columns. Each distinct column value (pair) is a new partition. For example, "year=2000/month=01/file".
            - **Partition column name**: Select from the destination columns in schemas mapping when you append data to a new table. When you append data to an existing table that already has partitions, the partition columns are derived from the existing table automatically. Supported data types are string, integer, boolean, and datetime. Format respects type conversion settings under the **Mapping** tab. 
        - **Overwrite**: Overwrite the existing data and schema in the table using the new values. If this operation is selected, you can enable partition on your target table:
          - **Enable Partition**: This selection allows you to create partitions in a folder structure based on one or multiple columns. Each distinct column value (pair) is a new partition. For example, "year=2000/month=01/file".
            - **Partition column name**: Select from the destination columns in schemas mapping. Supported data types are string, integer, boolean, and datetime. Format respects type conversion settings under the **Mapping** tab.
        
          It supports [Delta Lake time travel](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-batch.html#-deltatimetravel). The overwritten table has delta logs for the previous versions, which you can access in your Lakehouse. You can also copy the previous version table from Lakehouse, by specifying **Version** in the copy activity source.
        - **Upsert (Preview)**: Insert new values to existing table and update existing values. Upsert is not supported when using partitioned Lakehouse tables.
            - **Key columns**: Choose which column is used to determine if a row from the source matches a row from the destination. A drop-down listing all destination columns. You can select one or more columns to be treated as key columns while writing into Lakehouse Table.

      - **Max concurrent connections**: The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.

  - If you select **Files**:
    - **File path**: Select **Browse** to choose the file that you want to copy, or fill in the path manually.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/files-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing files path in destination." lightbox="./media/connector-lakehouse/files-path.png":::

    - **File format**: Select your file format from the drop-down list. Select **Settings** to configure the file format. For settings of different file formats, refer to articles in [Supported format](#supported-format) for detailed information.
    - Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:
      - **Copy behavior**: Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store. You can choose **Flatten hierarchy**, **Merge files**, **Preserve hierarchy**, or **Add Dynamic content** as your copy behavior. The configuration of each setting isï¼š
        - **Flatten hierarchy**: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the destination folder. The destination files have autogenerated names.
        - **Merge files**: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an auto-generated file name.
        
        - **Preserve hierarchy**: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of a source file to the source folder is identical to the relative path of a target file to the target folder.
        - **Add dynamic content**: To specify an expression for a property value, select **Add dynamic content**. This field opens the expression builder where you can build expressions from supported system variables, activity output, functions, and user-specified variables or parameters. For more information about the expression language, go to [Expressions and functions](/azure/data-factory/control-flow-expression-language-functions).

          :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/copy-behavior.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing copy behavior." lightbox="./media/connector-lakehouse/copy-behavior.png":::

      - **Max concurrent connections**: The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.
      - **Block size (MB)**: Specify the block size in MB when writing data to Lakehouse. Allowed value is between 4 MB and 100 MB.
      - **Metadata**: Set custom metadata when copying to the destination data store. Each object under the `metadata` array represents an extra column. The `name` defines the metadata key name, and the `value` indicates the data value of that key. If [preserve attributes feature](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-preserve-metadata#preserve-metadata) is used, the specified metadata will union/overwrite with the source file metadata. The allowed data values are:
        - `$$LASTMODIFIED`: a reserved variable indicates to store the source files' last modified time. Apply to a file-based source with binary format only.
        - Expression
        - Static value

          :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/metadata.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing metadata." lightbox="./media/connector-lakehouse/metadata.png":::

### Mapping

For the **Mapping** tab configuration, if you don't apply Lakehouse table as your destination data store, go to [Mapping](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab). 

If you apply Lakehouse table as your destination data store, except the configuration in [Mapping](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab), you can edit the type for your destination columns. After selecting **Import schemas**, you can specify the column type in your destination.

For example, the type for *PersonID* column in source is int, and you can change it to string type when mapping to destination column.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-lakehouse/configure-mapping-destination-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot of mapping destination column type.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Editing the destination type currently is not supported when your source is decimal type.

If you choose Binary as your file format, mapping isn't supported.

### Settings

For the **Settings** tab configuration, go to [Settings](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-other-settings-under-settings-tab).

## Delta Lake table support

In the sections below, you will find detailed information on Delta Lake table support for both the source and destination.

### Source

Reader version 1 is supported. You can find the corresponding supported Delta Lake features in this [article](https://docs.delta.io/latest/versioning.html#features-by-protocol-version).

[Delta column mapping](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-column-mapping.html) is supported when you apply reader version 2 or reader version 3 with `columnMapping` in `readerFeatures` in your Lakehouse table. 

Delta table's column mapping capability allows for more flexible schema evolution, ensuring that changes in table structure do not disrupt data workflows. With column mapping, you can read data from an existing delta Lake table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` or `id`.

[Deletion vectors](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html) is supported 
when you apply reader version 3 with `deletionVectors` in `readerFeatures` in your Lakehouse table. Rows that are soft deleted are marked in deletion vector files and skipped when reading the delta lake table. 

### Destination

Writer version 2 is supported. You can find the corresponding supported Delta Lake features in this [article](https://docs.delta.io/latest/versioning.html#features-by-protocol-version).

[Delta column mapping](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-column-mapping.html) is supported. This capability allows for more flexible schema evolution, ensuring that changes in table structure do not disrupt data workflows. With column mapping, you can:

- Write data to an existing delta lake table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` or `id`.
- Auto-create a table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` when the destination table does not exist and the source columns include special characters and whitespaces.
- Auto-create a table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` when the table action is overwrite and the source dataset columns include special characters and whitespaces.
