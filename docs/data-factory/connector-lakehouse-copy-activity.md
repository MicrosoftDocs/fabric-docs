# Configure Lakehouse in a copy activity

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in a pipeline to copy data from and to the Fabric Lakehouse. By default, data is written to Lakehouse Table in V-Order, and you can go to [Delta Lake table optimization and V-Order](../data-engineering/delta-optimization-and-v-order.md#what-is-v-order) for more information.

## Supported format

Lakehouse supports the following file formats. Refer to each article for format-based settings.

- [Avro format](format-avro.md)
- [Binary format](format-binary.md)
- [Delimited text format](format-delimited-text.md)
- [Excel format](format-excel.md)
- [JSON format](format-json.md)
- [ORC format](format-orc.md)
- [Parquet format](format-parquet.md)
- [XML format](format-xml.md)

## Supported configuration

For the configuration of each tab under copy activity, go to the following sections respectively.

- [General](#general)  
- [Source](#source)
- [Destination](#destination)
- [Mapping](#mapping)
- [Settings](#settings)

### General

The following properties are **required**:

- **Connection**: Select a Lakehouse connection from the connection list. If no connection exists, then create a new Lakehouse connection. If you apply **Use dynamic content** to specify your Lakehouse, add a parameter and specify the Lakehouse object ID as the parameter value. To get your Lakehouse object ID, open your Lakehouse in your workspace, and the ID is after `/lakehouses/`in your URL.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/lakehouse-object-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Lakehouse object ID.":::

- **Lakehouse**: Select an existing Lakehouse that you want to use.

- **Root folder**: Select **Tables** or **Files**, which indicates the virtual view of the managed or unmanaged area in your lake. For more information, refer to [Lakehouse introduction](../data-engineering/lakehouse-overview.md).

  - If you select **Tables**:
    - **Use query**: Select from **Table** or **T-SQL Query**.
      - If you select **Table**:
        - **Table**: Choose an existing table from the table list or specify a table name as the source. Or you can select **New** to create a new table.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/table-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing table name.":::

          When you apply Lakehouse with schemas in the connection, choose an existing table with a schema from the table list or specify a table with a schema as the source. Or you can select **New** to create a new table with a schema. If you don't specify a schema name, the service will use *dbo* as the default schema.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/table-name-with-schema.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing table name with schema.":::  
          
        - Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:
          - **Timestamp**: Specify to query an older snapshot by timestamp.
          - **Version**: Specify to query an older snapshot by version.
          - **Additional columns**: Add additional data columns to the store source files' relative path or static value. Expression is supported for the latter.

      - If you select **T-SQL Query**:
        - **T-SQL Query**: Specify the custom query to read data through the [Lakehouse SQL analytics endpoint](../data-engineering/lakehouse-sql-analytics-endpoint.md). For example: `SELECT * FROM MyTable`. T-SQL Query are usying Lakehouse SQL analytics endpoint.
        Note that Lakehouse table query mode does not support workspace private link.

            If you select **None**, you choose not to use partition.

            If you select **Dynamic range**, when using query with parallel enabled, range partition parameter(`?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition`) is needed. Sample query: `SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition`.
              - **Partition column name**: Specify the name of the source column in **integer** type that's used by range partitioning for parallel copy. If not specified, the index or the primary key of the table is auto-detected and used as the partition column.
                  If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Lakehouse table](#parallel-copy-from-lakehouse-table) section.
            
              - **Partition upper bound**: Specify the maximum value of the partition column for partition range splitting. This value is used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table or query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Lakehouse table](#parallel-copy-from-lakehouse-table) section.
            
              - **Partition lower bound**: Specify the minimum value of the partition column for partition range splitting. This value is used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table or query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Lakehouse table](#parallel-copy-from-lakehouse-table) section.

    - **Table actions**: Specify the operation against the selected table.
        - **Append**: Append new values to existing table. Under **Advanced**, you can enable partition on your target table: 
          - **Enable Partition**: This selection allows you to create partitions in a folder structure based on one or multiple columns. Each distinct column value (pair) is a new partition. For example, "year=2000/month=01/file".
            - **Partition column name**: Select from the destination columns in schemas mapping when you append data to a new table. When you append data to an existing table that already has partitions, the partition columns are derived from the existing table automatically. Supported data types are string, integer, boolean, and datetime. Format respects type conversion settings under the **Mapping** tab. 
        - **Overwrite**: Overwrite the existing data and schema in the table using the new values. Under **Advanced**, you can enable partition on your target table: 
          - **Enable Partition**: This selection allows you to create partitions in a folder structure based on one or multiple columns. Each distinct column value (pair) is a new partition. For example, "year=2000/month=01/file".
            - **Partition column name**: Select from the destination columns in schemas mapping. Supported data types are string, integer, boolean, and datetime. Format respects type conversion settings under the **Mapping** tab.
    
          It supports [Delta Lake time travel](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-batch.html#-deltatimetravel). The overwritten table has delta logs for the previous versions, which you can access in your Lakehouse. You can also copy the previous version table from Lakehouse, by specifying **Version** in the copy activity source.
        - **Upsert (Preview)**: Insert new values to existing table and update existing values. Upsert is not supported when using partitioned Lakehouse tables. Partition cannot be enabled while this action is selected.
            - **Key columns**: Choose which column is used to determine if a row from the source matches a row from the destination. A drop-down listing all destination columns. You can select one or more columns to be treated as key columns while writing into Lakehouse Table.
    
    - Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:
      - **Apply V-Order**: Specify to apply V-Order via copy. Disabling it preserves the original parquet files without applying additional V-Order optimization. For more information, see [Delta Lake table optimization and V-Order](../data-engineering/delta-optimization-and-v-order.md).

  - If you select **Files**:
    - **File path**: Select **Browse** to choose the file that you want to copy, or fill in the path manually.

    - **File format**: Select your file format from the drop-down list. Select **Settings** to configure the file format. For settings of different file formats, refer to articles in [Supported format](#supported-format) for detailed information.
    - Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:
      - **Copy behavior**: Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store. You can choose **Flatten hierarchy**, **Merge files**, **Preserve hierarchy**, or **Add Dynamic content** as your copy behavior. The configuration of each setting is：
        - **Flatten hierarchy**: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the destination folder. The destination files have autogenerated names.
        - **Merge files**: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an auto-generated file name.
        
        - **Preserve hierarchy**: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of a source file to the source folder is identical to the relative path of a target file to the target folder.
        - **Add dynamic content**: To specify an expression for a property value, select **Add dynamic content**. This field opens the expression builder where you can build expressions from supported system variables, activity output, functions, and user-specified variables or parameters. For more information about the expression language, go to [Expressions and functions](/azure/data-factory/control-flow-expression-language-functions).

          :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-lakehouse/copy-behavior.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing copy behavior." lightbox="./media/connector-lakehouse/copy-behavior.png":::

      - **Max concurrent connections**: The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.
      - **Block size (MB)**: Specify the block size in MB when writing data to Lakehouse. Allowed value is between 4 MB and 100 MB.
      - **Metadata**: Set custom metadata when copying to the destination data store. Each object under the `metadata` array represents an extra column. The `name` defines the metadata key name, and the `value` indicates the data value of that key. If [preserve attributes feature](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-preserve-metadata#preserve-metadata) is used, the specified metadata will union/overwrite with the source file metadata. The allowed data values are:
        - `$$LASTMODIFIED`: a reserved variable indicates to store the source files' last modified time. Apply to a file-based source with binary format only.
        - Expression
        - Static value

### Mapping

For the **Mapping** tab configuration, if you don't apply Lakehouse table as your destination data store, go to [Mapping](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab). 

If you apply Lakehouse table as your destination data store, except the configuration in [Mapping](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab), you can edit the type for your destination columns. After selecting **Import schemas**, you can specify the column type in your destination.

For example, the type for *PersonID* column in source is int, and you can change it to string type when mapping to destination column.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-lakehouse/configure-mapping-destination-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot of mapping destination column type.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Editing the destination type currently is not supported when your source is decimal type.

If you choose Binary as your file format, mapping isn't supported.

#### Data type mapping for Lakehouse table

When copying data from Lakehouse table, the following mappings are used from Lakehouse table data types to interim data types used by the service internally.

| Lakehouse table data type | Interim service data type |
|---------------------|------------------|
| string              | String           |
| long                | Int64            |

### Settings

For the **Settings** tab configuration, go to [Settings](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-other-settings-under-settings-tab).

## Parallel copy from Lakehouse table

The Lakehouse table connector in copy activity provides built-in data partitioning to copy data in parallel. You can find data partitioning options on the **Source** tab of the copy activity.

When you enable partitioned copy, copy activity runs parallel queries against your Lakehouse table source to load data by partitions. The parallel degree is controlled by the **Degree of copy parallelism** in the copy activity settings tab. For example, if you set **Degree of copy parallelism** to four, the service concurrently generates and runs four queries based on your specified partition option and settings, and each query retrieves a portion of data from your Lakehouse table.

You are suggested to enable parallel copy with data partitioning especially when you load large amount of data from your Lakehouse table. The following are suggested configurations for different scenarios. When copying data into file-based data store, it's recommended to write to a folder as multiple files (only specify folder name), in which case the performance is better than writing to a single file.

| Scenario                                                     | Suggested settings                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full load from large table, without physical partitions, while with an integer or datetime column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Partition column** (optional): Specify the column used to partition data. If not specified, the index or primary key column is used.<br/>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound** (optional): Specify if you want to determine the partition stride. This is not for filtering the rows in table, all rows in the table will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detects the values and it can take long time depending on MIN and MAX values. It is recommended to provide upper bound and lower bound. <br><br>For example, if your partition column "ID" has values range from 1 to 100, and you set the lower bound as 20 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy as 4, the service retrieves data by 4 partitions - IDs in range <=20, [21, 50], [51, 80], and >=81, respectively. |

## Delta Lake table support

In the sections below, you will find detailed information on Delta Lake table support for both the source and destination.

### Source

[Delta column mapping](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-column-mapping.html) is supported when you apply reader version 2 or reader version 3 with `columnMapping` in `readerFeatures` in your Lakehouse table. 

Delta table's column mapping capability allows for more flexible schema evolution, ensuring that changes in table structure do not disrupt data workflows. With column mapping, you can read data from an existing delta Lake table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` or `id`.

[Deletion vectors](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html) is supported 
when you apply reader version 3 with `deletionVectors` in `readerFeatures` in your Lakehouse table. Rows that are soft deleted are marked in deletion vector files and skipped when reading the delta lake table. 

[Change Data Feed](https://docs.delta.io/delta-change-data-feed/) is supported.

### Destination

[Delta column mapping](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-column-mapping.html) is supported. This capability allows for more flexible schema evolution, ensuring that changes in table structure do not disrupt data workflows. With column mapping, you can:

- Write data to an existing delta lake table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name`.
- Auto-create a table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` when the destination table does not exist and the source columns include special characters and whitespaces.
- Auto-create a table with `delta.columnMapping.mode` set to `name` when the table action is overwrite and the source dataset columns include special characters and whitespaces.

[Deletion vectors](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html) is supported.

[Change Data Feed](https://docs.delta.io/delta-change-data-feed/) is supported.
