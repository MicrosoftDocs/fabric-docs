# Enable workspace monitoring in Microsoft Fabric

Workspace monitoring gives you log-level visibility for all items in a workspace, including pipelines. It stores execution logs in a monitoring eventhouse so you can query and analyze them using KQL (Kusto Query Language).

## Enable workspace monitoring

1. In your Fabric workspace, select **Workspace Settings**, then select the **Monitoring** tab.

1. Turn on **Log workspace activity**. This creates an eventhouse in your workspace to store logs. Fabric also creates a read-only KQL database inside the eventhouse for monitoring data.

1. Go to the KQL database. You can find it in the **Monitoring database** link within the monitoring settings or in your workspace.

1. In the KQL database, the **ItemJobEventLogs** table captures pipeline-level events from your workspace. Logs include pipeline name, run status, timestamps, and system diagnostics.

## Review logged data

The **ItemJobEventLogs** table includes:

- Pipeline name
- Run status (Success/Failed)
- Start and end timestamps
- System diagnostics

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, workspace monitoring supports L1 monitoring (pipeline-level). Activity-level (L2) monitoring isn't available yet.

## Query logs

1. Go to the monitoring eventhouse.
1. Use KQL queries to analyze:
   - Success and failure trends
   - Performance metrics

Here's an example query:

```kql
ItemJobEventLogs 
| where ItemKind == "Pipeline" 
| summarize count() by JobStatus 
```

### ItemJobEventLogs schema

The following table describes the schema of `ItemJobEventLogs`:

| **Column name** | **Column type** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| Timestamp | datetime | The timestamp (UTC) when the log entry was generated. |
| ItemId | string | Unique ID of the item that's logging the data. |
| ItemKind | string | Type of item that's logging the operation. |
| ItemName | string | The name of the Fabric item that's logging this operation. |
| WorkspaceId | string | Unique identifier of the Fabric workspace that contains the item. |
| WorkspaceName | string | The name of the workspace that contains the item. |
| CapacityId | string | Unique identifier of the capacity that hosts the item. |
| DurationMs | long | Amount of time in milliseconds taken by the job. |
| ExecutingPrincipalId | string | User ID or service principal ID that runs the job. |
| ExecutingPrincipalType | string | User or service principal that runs the job. |
| WorkspaceMonitoringTableName | string | The name of the table where records belong. |
| JobInstanceId | string | Unique identifier of the job instance. |
| JobInvokeType | string | On demand or scheduled. |
| JobType | string | Job type. Values are listed in the job type table above. |
| JobStatus | string | Status of the job. Values can be Not started, In progress, Completed, or Failed. |
| JobDefinitionObjectId | string | ID of the scheduler that triggered the job. |
| JobScheduleTime | datetime | Scheduled job start time. |
| JobStartTime | datetime | Actual job start time. |
| JobEndTime | datetime | Actual job end time. |

## Best practices

- Use workspace monitoring for deep analysis and custom reporting.
- Combine workspace monitoring with the monitoring hub for quick operational checks across workspaces.
