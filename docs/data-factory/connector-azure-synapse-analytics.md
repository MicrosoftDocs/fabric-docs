## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to Azure Synapse Analytics. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to Azure Synapse Analytics in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the Azure Synapse Analytics connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric-preview).
- Be sure to install or set up any [Azure Synapse Analytics prerequisites](/power-query/connectors/azure-sql-data-warehouse#prerequisites) before connecting to the Azure Synapse Analytics connector.
- To connect to the Azure Synapse Analytics connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to Azure Synapse Analytics from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/azure-sql-data-warehouse#connect-to-azure-synapse-analytics-sql-dw-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.
