# Set up your FHIR data connection

This article outlines the steps to create a FHIR data connection.


## Supported authentication types

The FHIR connector supports the following authentication types for copy and Dataflow Gen2 respectively.  

|Authentication type |Copy |Dataflow Gen2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Anonymous| n/a | √ |
|Organizational account| n/a | √ |

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to FHIR data. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to FHIR data in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the FHIR connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric-preview).
- Be sure to install or set up any [FHIR prerequisites](/power-query/connectors/fhir/fhir#prerequisites) before connecting to the FHIR connector.
- To connect to the FHIR connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to a FHIR server from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/fhir/fhir#connect-to-a-fhir-server-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.

## Set up your connection in a data pipeline

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric doesn't currently support FHIR in data pipelines.
