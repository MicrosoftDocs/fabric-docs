# Set up your SharePoint list connection

This article outlines the steps to create a SharePoint list connection.


## Supported authentication types

The SharePoint list connector supports the following authentication types for copy and Dataflow Gen2 respectively.  

|Authentication type |Copy |Dataflow Gen2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Anonymous| n/a | √ |
|Windows| n/a | √ |

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to a SharePoint list. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to a SharePoint list in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the SharePoint list connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric-preview).
- To determine the URL to use to access your SharePoint list, go to [Determine the site URL](/power-query/connectors/sharepoint-list#determine-the-site-url).
- To connect to the SharePoint list connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to a SharePoint list from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/sharepoint-list#connect-to-a-sharepoint-list-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.

## Set up your connection in a data pipeline

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric doesn't currently support a SharePoint list in data pipelines.
