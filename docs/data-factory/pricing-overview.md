# Data Factory pricing in Microsoft Fabric

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric provides serverless and elastic data integration service capabilities built for cloud scale. There's no fixed-size compute power that you need to plan for peak load; rather you need to specify which operations to perform while authoring pipelines and dataflows, which translates into an amount of **Fabric Capacity Units** consumed, that you can further track using the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](../enterprise/metrics-app.md) to plan and manage your consumption metrics. This allows you to design the ETL processes in a much more scalable manner. In addition, Data Factory, like other Fabric experiences, is billed on a consumption-based plan, which means you only pay for what you use.

## Microsoft Fabric Capacities

Fabric is a unified data platform that offers shared experiences, architecture, governance, compliance, and billing. Capacities provide the computing power that drives all of these experiences. They offer a simple and unified way to scale resources to meet customer demand and can be easily increased with a SKU upgrade.

You can manage your Fabric Data Factory run costs easily with simplified billing. Additional users don't require any cost management on a per-user basis, and you can save money by planning and committing Fabric capacities for your data integration projects ahead. With the pay-as-you-go option, you can easily scale your capacities up and down to adjust their computing power and pause their capacities when not in use to save costs. Learn more about [Fabric capacities](../enterprise/licenses.md) and [usage billing](../enterprise/azure-billing.md).

## Data Factory pricing meters

Whether youâ€™re a citizen or professional developer, Data Factory enables you to develop enterprise-scale data integration solutions with next-generation dataflows and data pipelines. These experiences operate on multiple services with different capacity meters. Data pipelines use **Data Orchestration** and **Data Movement** meters, while Dataflow Gen2 uses **Standard Compute** and **High Scale Compute**. Additionally, like other Fabric experiences, the common meter for storage consumption is OneLake Storage.
