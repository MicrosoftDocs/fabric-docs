# Use the **Invoke pipeline activity** to run another pipeline

The Fabric **Invoke pipeline activity** can execute another [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] pipeline. You can use it to orchestrate the execution of one or multiple pipelines from within a single pipeline. This is useful for organizing, reusing, and managing complex workflows. The invoke pipeline activity can be very helpful in making reusable, modular pipeline patterns by calling other pipelines that have a specific purpose.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

> [!NOTE]
> There are currently two Invoke pipeline activities. The Invoke pipeline (Legacy) only supports Fabric pipelines in the same workspace as your parent pipeline. You can also only monitor the parent pipeline and can't invoke ADF (Azure Data Factory) or Synapse pipelines using the legacy activity. Using the new Invoke pipeline activity allows you to invoke pipelines across Fabric workspaces, from ADF or Synapse, and monitor child pipelines.

## Add an **Invoke pipeline activity** to a pipeline with UI

To use an **Invoke pipeline activity** in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Create the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for **invoke pipeline** in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

1. Select the new **Invoke pipeline activity** on the canvas if it isn't already selected.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Invoke pipeline (legacy) settings
Select the **Settings** tab, and choose an existing pipeline from the **Invoked pipeline** dropdown, or use the **+ New** button to create a new pipeline directly. You can choose to wait on completion, or continue directly, in which case the invoked pipeline executes in parallel with activities following it within the parent pipeline's execution flow.

### Invoke pipeline settings

Select the **Settings** tab and configure your activity. 

#### Invoke pipelines from Fabric

* Type: Select **Fabric** the source of your pipeline.

* Connection: Each **Invoke pipeline activity** requires a Connection object that is stored in the secure Fabric credentials store. This connection object stores your user token associated with your Fabric workspace. If you haven't yet created a new **Invoke pipeline activity**, you are required to create a new connection object first before you can use the activity.

   When setting up your pipeline connection, you will now have 3 options for **Authentication kind**: Organizational account, service principal, or workspace identity.

* Workspace: Choose the Fabric workspace where the target pipeline is located that you wish to invoke from your parent pipeline.

* Pipeline: Select the pipeline you want to invoke.

#### Invoke pipelines from ADF and Synapse

- Type: Choose the source of your pipeline (Fabric, Azure Data Factory, Synapse)
- Connection: Reference to Fabric, Azure Data Factory, or Synapse registered as a connection
- Pipeline: Select the pipeline name you wish to invoke

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

Switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.

## Known issues
- Some customers may not see the Workspace Identity (WI) dropdown, or may see it but be unable to create a connection. This behavior is due to a known issue in one of our underlying platform components. The fix is currently being worked on.
