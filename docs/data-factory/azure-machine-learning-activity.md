# Use the Azure Machine Learning activity to run a job on an Azure Machine Learning instance

The Azure Machine Learning activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to run a job on an Azure Machine Learning instance.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../fundamentals/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add an Azure Machine Learning activity to a pipeline with UI

To use an Azure Machine Learning activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Create the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for Azure Machine Learning in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may need to expand the menu and scroll down to see the Azure Machine Learning activity as highlighted in following the screenshot.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Azure Machine Learning activity settings

1. Select the **Settings** tab, then you can choose an existing or create a new **Azure Machine Learning connection**. 
1. Choose and **Endpoint type**, either Batch Endpoint or Pipeline (v1).
1. Provide a **Batch endpoint** and **Batch deployment** and configure **Job settings for the [Batch Endpoint](/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints-batch) type, or provide the pipeline details to run an [Azure Machine Learning Pipeline (v1)](/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines).

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
