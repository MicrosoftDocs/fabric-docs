# How to use Stored procedure activity

In this article, you learn how to add a new Stored procedure activity to a pipeline, add a new connection, and configure the activity to run.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:  

- A tenant account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.
- A workspace is created.

## Step 1: Add a new Stored procedure activity in Pipeline canvas

1. Open an existing data pipeline or create a new data pipeline.
1. Select the **Stored procedure** activity.

## Step 2: Add a new connection for SQL

1. Select the **Settings** tab. Select **New** to create a new connection.

2. In the new popup window, choose the target SQL source type, then select **Continue**. The Stored procedure activity in Fabric currently supports Azure SQL and Azure SQL Managed instances.

## Step 3: Choose a stored procedure and configure parameters

Select a stored procedure, and optionally import its parameters or manually add parameters. Select the **Import** button to import the parameters from the stored procedure as it is stored in the data source, or add them manually by selecting the **+ New** button for each parameter, then providing its name and data type, and nullability setting. Provide a value for each parameter, either by entering text directly, or by using a [custom expression](expression-language.md) to populate the value.

## Step 4: Save and run or schedule the pipeline

Switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
