# Set up your SAP BW Message Server connection

This article outlines the steps to create an SAP BW Message Server connection.


## Supported authentication types

The SAP BW Message Server connector supports the following authentication types for copy and Dataflow Gen2 respectively.  

|Authentication type |Copy |Dataflow Gen2 |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Basic (Username/Password)| n/a | √ |
|Windows| n/a | √ |

## Set up your connection in Dataflow Gen2

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric uses Power Query connectors to connect Dataflow Gen2 to an SAP BW Message Server. The following links provide the specific Power Query connector information you need to connect to an SAP BW Message Server in Dataflow Gen2:

- To get started using the SAP BW Message Server connector in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Get data from Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/power-query/where-to-get-data#get-data-from-data-factory-in-microsoft-fabric-preview).
- Be sure to install or set up any [SAP BW Message Server prerequisites](/power-query/connectors/sap-bw/message-setup-and-connect#prerequisites) before connecting to the SAP BW Message Server connector.
- To connect to the SAP BW Message Server connector from Power Query, go to [Connect to an SAP BW Message Server from Power Query Online](/power-query/connectors/sap-bw/message-setup-and-connect#connect-to-an-sap-bw-message-server-from-power-query-online).

In some cases, the Power Query connector article might include advanced options, troubleshooting, known issues and limitations, and other information that could also prove useful.

## Set up your connection in a data pipeline

Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric doesn't currently support an SAP BW Message Server in data pipelines.
