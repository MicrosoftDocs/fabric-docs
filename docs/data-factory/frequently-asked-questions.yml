  - name: Data Factory in Fabric
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is the difference between data factory and data engineering tab in Fabric?
        answer: |
          Data Factory helps you solve complex data integration and ETL scenarios with cloud-scale data movement and data transformation services while data engineering helps you create lake house, use Apache Spark to transform and prepare your data. Differences between each of the Fabric terminologies / experiences are available under [Microsoft Fabric terminology](../fundamentals/fabric-terminology.md).    
      - question: |
          How do I track and monitor the capacity of Fabric used with the pipelines?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Fabric capacity admins can use [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics](../enterprise/metrics-app-install.md?tabs=1st) app, also known as the metrics app, to gain visibility into capacity resources. This app enables admins to see how much CPU utilization, processing time, and memory are utilized by pipelines, dataflows, and other items in their Fabric capacity-enabled workspaces. Gain visibility into overload causes, peak demand times, resource consumption and more and easily identify the most demanding or most popular items.
      - question: |
          What approach is recommended for assigning roles within Data Factory in Fabric?
        answer: |
          You can separate the different workloads between workspaces and use the roles like member and viewer to have a workspace for data engineering that preps data for a workspace that is used for report or AI training. With the viewer role, you can then consume data from the data engineering workspace.
      - question: |
          Is it possible to connect to existing Private Endpoint (PE) enabled resources in Fabric Data Factory?
        answer: |
          Presently, the virtual network gateway offers an injective method to seamlessly integrate into your virtual network, providing a robust avenue for using private endpoints to establish secure connections to your data stores. It's important to note that the virtual network gateway only accommodates Fabric dataflows at this moment. However, our upcoming initiatives encompass expanding its capabilities to encompass Fabric pipelines.

  - name: Pipelines
    questions:
      - question: |
          How fast can I ingest data in Fabric pipelines?
        answer: |
          Fabric Data Factory allows you to develop pipelines that maximize data movement throughput for your environment. These pipelines fully utilize the following resources: 
          - Network bandwidth between the source and destination data stores 
          - Source or destination data store input/output operations per second (IOPS) and bandwidth
          This full utilization means you can estimate the overall throughput by measuring the minimum throughput available with the following resources: 
          - Source data store 
          - Destination data store 
          - Network bandwidth in between the source and destination data stores 
          Meanwhile, we continuously work on innovations to boost the best possible throughput you can achieve. Today, the service can move 1-TB TPC-DI dataset (parquet files) into both Fabric Lakehouse table and Data Warehouse within 5 minutes - moving 1B rows under 1 min; Note that this performance is only a reference by running the above testing dataset. The actual throughput still depends on the factors listed previously. In addition, you can always multiply your throughput by running multiple copy activities in parallel. For example, using ForEach loop.
      - question: |
          Will CDC feature be available within Data Factory in Fabric?
        answer: |
          Our current focus involves the active development of CDC capability within Data Factory In Fabric. This forthcoming capability empowers you to move data across multiple data sources combining different copy patterns including bulk/batch copy pattern, incremental/continuous copy pattern (CDC) and real time copy pattern into one 5x5 experience.

  - name: Dataflow Gen2
    questions:
      - question: |
          Is Fabric Dataflow Gen2 similar to Power Query embedded in Azure Data Factory?
        answer: |
          The Power Query activity within ADF shares similarities with Dataflow Gen2, but it has extra features that enable actions like writing to specific data destinations etc. This comparison aligns more fairly with Dataflow Gen1 (Power BI dataflows or Power Apps dataflows). Have a look here for more details: [Differences between Dataflow Gen1 and Dataflow Gen2](dataflows-gen2-overview.md).
      - question: |
          Within Fabric DataFlow Gen2, I occasionally encounter features such as DataflowsStaginglakehouse / DataflowsStagingwarehouse. What are these features?
        answer: |
          In certain user experiences, you may encounter system items not intended for interaction. It's best to disregard these items, as they'll eventually be removed from the Get Data experiences in the future.
      - question: |
          My refresh failed with the error message "The dataflow refresh failed due to insufficient permissions for accessing staging artifacts." What should I do?
        answer: |
          This error message occurs when the user who created the first dataflow in the workspace hasn't logged in to Fabric for more than 90 days or has left the organization. To resolve it, the user mentioned in the error message should log in to Fabric. If the user has left the organization, please [open a support ticket](/power-bi/support/service-support-options).

While you're encouraged to continue utilizing ADF / Synapse pipelines if these features are necessary, we encourage you to first explore your new data integration possibilities in Fabric. Your feedback on which features are pivotal for your success is invaluable. To facilitate this, we're actively working on introducing a new capability, enabling the migration of your existing data factories from Azure into Fabric workspaces as well.
      - question: |
          Are new features in Fabric Data Factory also available in ADF/Synapse?
        answer: |
          We don't backport new features from Fabric pipelines into ADF / Synapse pipelines. We maintain two separate roadmaps for Fabric Data Factory and ADF/ Synapse. We evaluate backport requests in response to incoming feedback.
      - question: |
          Are Fabric pipelines the same as Azure Synapse pipelines?
        answer: |
          The main function of Fabric pipeline is similar to Azure Synapse pipeline, but by using Fabric pipeline, users can apply all the data analytics capabilities in the Fabric platform. Notable differences and feature mappings between Fabric pipeline and Azure Synapse pipeline can be found here: [Differences between Data Factory in Fabric and Azure](compare-fabric-data-factory-and-azure-data-factory.md).
      - question: |
          How do I migrate existing pipelines from Azure Data Factory (or) Azure Synapse workspace to Fabric Data Factory? 
        answer: |
          To facilitate customers' transition to Microsoft Fabric from Azure Data Factory (ADF), we offer a range of essential features and support mechanisms. Firstly, we provide comprehensive support for most activities used in ADF within Fabric, along with the addition of new activities tailored for notifications, such as Teams and Outlook functionalities. Customers can access a [detailed list of available activities in Data Factory within Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/activity-overview).
