The SharePoint list connector is supported in Data Factory for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] with the following capabilities.


## Support in Dataflow Gen2

For information on how to connect to a SharePoint folder in Dataflow Gen2, go to [Set up your SharePoint list connection](connector-sharepoint-list.md).

## Support in data pipelines

Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] doesn't currently support a SharePoint list in data pipelines.
