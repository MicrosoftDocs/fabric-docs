# Migrate from Dataflow Gen1 to Dataflow Gen2

This article targets Power BI dataflow creators. It provides them with guidance and rationale to help migrate their dataflows to Dataflow Gen2 in [Data Factory](data-factory-overview.md) for Microsoft Fabric.

> [!NOTE]
> Dataflow Gen2 is a new generation of dataflows that delivers new features and improved experiences. Gen2 dataflows reside alongside Power BI dataflows, which are now known as _Dataflow Gen1_.
>
> To understand the differences between Dataflow Gen1 and Dataflow Gen2, see [Getting from Dataflow Generation 1 to Dataflow Generation 2](dataflows-gen2-overview.md).

## Background

Microsoft Fabric has evolved into an integrated platform for both self-service and IT-managed enterprise data. With exponential growth in data volumes and complexity, Fabric customers demand that their enterprise solutions scale, are secure, easy to manage, and accessible to all users across the largest of organizations.

In recent years, Microsoft has taken great strides to deliver scalable cloud capabilities to [Fabric capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity). To that end, Data Factory in Fabric instantly empowers a large ecosystem of data integration developers and data integration solutions that have been built up over decades. It leverages the full set of features and capabilities that go far beyond comparable functionality available in previous generations.

Naturally, customers are now asking whether there's an opportunity to consolidate their data integration solutions by hosting them within Fabric. They often ask questions like:

- Does all the dataflow functionality we depend on work in Dataflow Gen2?
- What capabilities are available only in Dataflow Gen2?
- How do we migrate existing dataflows to Dataflow Gen2?
- What's Microsoft's roadmap for enterprise data ingestion?

Answers to many of these questions are described in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> The decision to migrate to Fabric capacity depends on the requirements of each customer. Customers should carefully evaluate the benefits in order to make an informed decision. We expect to see organic migration to Dataflow Gen2 over time, and our intention is that it happens on terms that the customer is comfortable with.
>
> To be clear, currently there aren't any plans to deprecate Power BI dataflows or Power Platform dataflows. However, there is a priority to focus investment on Dataflow Gen2 for enterprise data ingestion, and so the value provided by Fabric capacity will increase over time. Customers that choose Fabric capacity can expect to benefit from alignment with the [Microsoft Fabric product roadmap](https://aka.ms/fabricrm).

### Convergence of self-service and enterprise data integration

The consolidation of items in Fabric simplifies discovery, collaboration, and management by co-locating resources. It allows central IT teams to more easily adopt and integrate popular self-service items. At the same time, it allows operationalizing mission-critical data movement and transformation services aligned with corporate standards, including data lineage and monitoring.

To support the collaborative and scalable needs of creators, Dataflow Gen2 in Fabric introduces [fast copy](dataflows-gen2-fast-copy.md), which enables efficient ingestion of large data volumes by using Fabric's backend infrastructure to [store and process](data-in-staging-artifacts.md) intermediate data during transformation. It can handle terabytes of data seamlessly. Dataflow creators can specify [data destinations](dataflow-gen2-data-destinations-and-managed-settings.md) for their transformed data, such as a Fabric lakehouse, warehouse, eventhouse, or Azure SQL Database, facilitating better data management and accessibility. And what's more, the recent integration of generative AI through [Copilot](../fundamentals/copilot-fabric-data-factory.md) enhances the data preparation experience by providing intelligent code generation and automating repetitive tasks, providing an easier and faster path to create complex solutions.

By utilizing a common platform, the workflow is streamlined, which results in enhanced collaboration between the business and IT. Organizations are therefore empowered to scale their data solutions to enterprise levels, ensuring high performance, flexibility, and efficiency in managing vast volumes of data.

### Fabric capacity

Thanks to its distributed architecture, [Fabric capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity) is less sensitive to overall load, temporal spikes, and high concurrency. By consolidating capacities to larger Fabric capacity SKUs, customers can achieve increased performance and throughput.

## Considerations

There are other considerations to factor into your planning before migrating to Dataflow Gen2.

### Licensing

You require a Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license to publish or manage Power BI dataflows (Dataflow Gen1). In contrast, you only require a Microsoft Fabric (Free) license to author a Dataflow Gen2 in a Premium capacity workspace.

### Migration scenarios

When you migrate your dataflows, it's important to think beyond simply copying existing solutions. Instead, we recommend modernizing your solutions by taking advantage of the latest innovations and capabilities of Dataflow Gen2. This approach ensures that your solutions can support the growing demands of the business.

In the [migration scenarios article](dataflow-gen2-migrate-from-dataflow-gen1-scenarios.md), several methods for upgrading, taking inventory, and using accelerators like [Power Query templates](/power-query/power-query-template) are described. These methods can help to ensure a seamless upgrade for your projects.

### Roadmap

The [Microsoft Fabric release plan](https://aka.ms/fabricreleaseplan) announces the latest updates and timelines as features are prepared for future release, including what's new and planned for [Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabricrm).
