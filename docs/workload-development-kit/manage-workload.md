# Manage a workload in Fabric (preview)

This article describes how to upload and manage a workload to the Fabric service. Workloads enhance the usability of your service within a familiar workspace, eliminating the need to leave the Fabric environment. Fabric workloads increase user engagement and improve your applicationâ€™s discoverability in the Fabric store. The Fabric workspace includes various components, known as Fabric items, which handle the storage, analysis, and presentation of your data.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy a workload, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A Fabric account with the *Admin* permissions.
* The [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/) workload solution that you want to deploy. For information about creating a workload solution, see [QuickStart: Run a workload sample](quickstart-sample.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When a DevGateway is connected to Fabric backend, the developer workload takes precedence over the workload activated in the tenant. If you try to create an item in a workspace associated with the same capacity as the one registered in the DevGateway configuration, Fabric backend calls your local workload instead of the activated one. 

## Upload a workload

To upload a workload to the Fabric service, follow these steps:

1. Log into [Fabric](https://powerbi.com) with an *Admin* account.
