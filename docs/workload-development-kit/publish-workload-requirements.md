# Workload publishing requirements

This article describes the requirements that are needed for a custom workload to be listed in the Microsoft Fabric Workload Hub. Make sure your workload complies with these requirements before you submit your workload for publication.

_Definitions:_

* Required:
Workloads need to implement and comply with the requirement to pass validation.

* Optional:
Workloads can decide if they want to use or support this requirement or not. In any case, it needs to be documented in the Attestation document.

* Not-Supported:
Workloads can't support this requirement today because the platform doesn't allow it. To create transparency to the customer partners are still asked to put the information into their Attestation document.

## Business requirements

Building applications in Fabric is more like creating documents in office than provisioning resources in Azure. While we donâ€™t expect every user to be able to take advantage of every workload in Fabric, each of the workloads must appeal to the broadest set of users.

Fabric is designed to support the largest Tier 1 projects and data sizes. The Fabric platform provides a common set of services that the workload must not replace with their own proprietary services. Consistent use of the platform services across all the workloads ensures a uniform experience and functionality throughout the system.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all the different components that you need to take into account to publish a workload. Sharing this information upfront is required to move into Preview and GA, see [Publishing Flow](./publish-workload-flow.md).

| Name | Description | Validation method | Preview | General Availability | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value to customers | Your offer must provide enough value to justify the investment it takes to learn and use. Your offer should provide significant benefits such as enhanced efficiency, innovative features, or strategic advantages. | Attestation | Required | Required | |
| Terms and conditions | You need to provide your customers with terms and conditions for the offer you provide on the platform. In the terms and conditions you need to highlight the compliancy aspects of your solution. For example, what happens to data at rest and transit? Where are the services you provide Azure customers available from? | Workload Package | Required |Required | [Governance overview and guidance](../governance/governance-compliance-overview.md) |
| Metadata | Metadata such as title, summary, and icon, must be identical in the Workload package manifest and the SaaS offer submission in Partner Center. Add all the assets of the workload such as icons and screenshots under `fe/assests` directory. Your workload package has to comply with the frontend and [backend](extensibility-back-end.md) manifest requirements. | Workload Package | Required |Required | [Manifest](extensibility-back-end.md)
| Attestation Document | Partners need to provide a page that contains all the information about their workload publishing requirements status. This document needs to be linked in the Workload Package and kept up-to-date. You must add the link in the workload metadata manifest under the `supportLink` field in `certification`. The link must also appear in the workload product page in the Workload Hub. | Workload Package | Required | Required | |
| Trial | Provide an easy and fast trial experience. The trial should be available to the customer without waiting time (less than 5 seconds), and give the them a free and easy way to explore the offered workload. | Attestation | Required | Required | [Trials](monetization.md#trials) |
| Marketplace Offer | Partners need to enlist a SaaS offer in Azure Marketplace. This offer can just be a *contact us* listing to get leads from the platform. We expect partners to also transact over the Marketplace. You can build Bring Your Own License (BYOL) capabilities into your workload. | Workload Package | Required | Required | [Creating a SaaS offer](/partner-center/marketplace-offers/create-new-saas-offer) <br> <br> [Commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1000-software-as-a-service-saas) |

|  | The workload  must take a static dependency on `https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/Fabric.Extend` scope and get user consent for it. Workload Development Kit infrastructure helps to implement the consent flow, but the responsibility is with the workload owner to take dependency on Fabric. Extend scope and ensure consent is granted. Fabric reserves the rights to block the integration with a workload for which the consent isn't granted. | Workload Package | Required | Required | |
