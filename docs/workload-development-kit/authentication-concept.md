# Authentication overview (preview)

Fabric workloads rely on integration with [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) for authentication and authorization.

All interactions between workloads and other Fabric or Azure components must be accompanied by proper authentication support for requests received or sent. Tokens sent out must be generated properly, and tokens received must be validated properly as well.  

It's recommended that you become familiar with the [Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/) before starting to work with Fabric workloads. It's also recommended to go over [Microsoft identity platform best practices and recommendations](/entra/identity-platform/identity-platform-integration-checklist).

## Flows

<!--:::image type="content" source="./media/authentication-concept/authentication-diagram.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Workload Development Kit authentication flow.":::
-->

* From workload front-end to workload back-end

   An example of such communication is any data plane API. This communication is done with a Subject token (Delegated token).

   For information on how to acquire a token in the workload FE, read [Authentication API](./authentication-javascript-api.md). In addition, make sure you go over token validation in the [Back-end authentication and authorization overview](back-end-authentication.md).

* From Fabric back-end to workload back-end

   An example of such communication is Create workload item. This communication is done with a SubjectAndApp token, which is a special token that includes an app token and a subject token combined (see the [Back-end authentication and authorization overview](back-end-authentication.md) to learn more about this token).

   For this communication to work, the user using this communication must give consent to the Entra application.

* From workload back-end to Fabric back-end

   This is done with a SubjectAndApp token for workload control APIs (for example, ResolveItemPermissions), or with a Subject token (for other Fabric APIs).

* From workload back-end to external services

   An example of such communication is writing to a Lakehouse file. This is done with Subject token or an App token, depending on the API.

   If you plan on communicating with services using a Subject token, make sure you're familiar with [On behalf of flows](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow).

   Refer to [Authentication tutorial](./authentication-tutorial.md) to set up your environment to work with authentication.

## How to work with tokens

Your front-end should ask for a token `workloadClient.auth.acquireAccessToken({});`. You can use this token to authenticate with your back-end.

If you wish to access some resource, send your token to the back-end and try to exchange it using an OBO flow for that resource. You can also use the token received from control APIs (CRUD/Jobs) and try to exchange it for that resource.

If the exchange fails for consent reasons, notify your front-end and call `workloadClient.auth.acquireAccessToken({additionalScopesToConsent:[resource]});` and try the process again.

If the exchange fails for MFA reasons, notify your front-end along with the claim received when trying to exchange and call `workloadClient.auth.acquireAccessToken({claimsForConditionalAccessPolicy:claims});`.

   For examples, see: [Error response example](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow#error-response-example).

> [!NOTE]
> The token you receive when acquiring a token in the front-end is not related to additionalScopesToConsent you pass. This means that once the user consents, you can use any token you received from `workloadClient.auth.acquireAccessToken` for your OBO flow.

## Authentication JavaScript API

Fabric front-end offers a JavaScript API for Fabric workloads to acquire a token for their application in Microsoft Entra ID. Before working with the authentication JavaScript API, make sure you go over the [authentication JavaScript API](./authentication-javascript-api.md) documentation.

### API

`acquireAccessToken(params: AcquireAccessTokenParams): Promise<AccessToken>;`  
`export interface AcquireAccessTokenParams {`  
`    additionalScopesToConsent?: string[];`  
`    claimsForConditionalAccessPolicy?: string;`  
`}`

The API returns an AccessToken object that contains the token itself and an expiry date for the token.

To call the API in the Front-end sample, create a sample item and scroll down and select **Navigate to Authentication page**, from there you can select **Get access Token** and you'll receive a token back.

### Consents  

To understand why consents are required, review [User and admin consent in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview).  

> [!NOTE]
> Consents are required for CRUD/Jobs to work and to acquire tokens across tenants.

### How do consents work in Fabric workloads?

To grant a consent for a specific application, Fabric FE creates an [MSAL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-browser) instance configured with the workload's application ID and asks for a token for the provided scope (additionalScopesToConsent - see [AcquireAccessTokenParams](./authentication-javascript-api.md#acquireaccesstokenparams)). 

When asking for a token with the workload application for a specific scope, Microsoft Entra ID displays a popup consent in case it's missing, and then redirect the popup window to the **redirect URI** configured in the application.

Typically the redirect URI is in the same domain as the page that requested the token so the page can access the popup and close it.

In our case, it's not in the same domain since Fabric is requesting the token and the redirect URI of the workload isn't in the Fabric domain, so when the consent dialog opens, it needs to be closed manually after redirect - we don't use the code returned in the redirectUri, and hence we just autoclose it (when Microsoft Entra ID redirects the popup to the redirect URI, it closes).  

You can see the code/configuration of the redirect Uri in the file *index.ts*. This file can be found in the [Microsoft-Fabric-workload-development-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Fabric-workload-development-sample), under the front-end folder.

Here's an example of a consent popup for our app "my workload app" and its dependencies (storage and Power BI) that we configured when going over [the authentication set up](./authentication-tutorial.md):

We'll see how to work with consents when we talk about AcquireAccessTokenParams.

### Another way to grant consents in the home tenant (optional)

Refer to the [JavaScript API documentation](./authentication-javascript-api.md#another-way-to-grant-consents-in-the-home-tenant-optional) for more information on how to grant consents in the home tenant of the application using the following url (insert your tenant ID and the client ID):  

`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/adminconsent?client_id={clientId}`
