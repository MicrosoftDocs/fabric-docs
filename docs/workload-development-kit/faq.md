## General

## Fabric Workload Design

### What design language does Fabric use?

Fabric controls are aligned to the Fluent 2 design language. Visit the [Fabric UX System](https://aka.ms/fabricux)  page for more details.

### What are base (*.Base*) components?

Base components shouldn't be used in designs. They're meant only as a nested building block for the creation and management of component variants in the toolkit and aren't published via the library. Make sure youâ€˜re not using any components prefixed with *.Base* (nested *.Base* components are fine).

### Where can I find examples of common page layouts in Fabric?

Specific screens in Fabric are collected in the Page examples file while more generic layout templates are available in this file under Page templates.

### What guidelines should I follow if, I want to use icons in my workloads?

## Fabric Workload Business model

### What kind of trials can I offer?

You can choose how you want to structure the trial experience. If you want to provide a trial for an individual user or a whole tenant. You can also define If the trial is the same experience or has a limited functionality. Keep in mind that the Trial is the first impression of your product for a customer and you want to optimize it to your customer's expectations. 

### What business model should I choose for my SaaS offer?

This really depends on your offer. The Azure Marketplace provides different ways to monetize your offer (for example, per user, per your own metric, flat fee, ...). In the end, you want to optimize your business model to the needs of your customer. Further information can be found at [SaaS Pricing Models](/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer#saas-pricing-models).

### What can I do to support my existing customers in Fabric? 

You can choose if you want to offer the fabric capability to your customers as part of an existing license. For that you can provide a Bring your own license (BYOL) capability into your workload.

### I don't have an Azure Marketplace SaaS offer. Where can I get started?
