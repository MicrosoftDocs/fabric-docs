> [!NOTE]
> When developing and testing new attributes added to the manifest, ensure you have synced the latest [validation scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Fabric-developer-sample/tree/main/Frontend/validation) and [tools](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Fabric-workload-development-sample/tree/main/Frontend/tools) from our sample repository.

> This step is only necessary for local development and is not required for cloud mode.
