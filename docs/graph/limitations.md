# Current limitations of Graph in Microsoft Fabric

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](./includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

While Graph in Microsoft Fabric is in preview, the service has certain functional and performance limitations. This article highlights some key limitations but isn't an exhaustive list. Check back regularly for updates.

For help with common problems, see [Troubleshooting Graph in Microsoft Fabric](troubleshooting-and-faq.md).

## Creating graph models

### Data sources

- Graph currently doesn't support Lakehouse with schema enabled.
- OneLake parquet files are the only data sources currently supported.
- Power BI semantic model support is under development.

### Data types

Graph in Microsoft Fabric currently supports the following data types:

- Boolean (values are `true` and `false`)
- Double (values are 64-bit floating point numbers)
- Integer (values are 64-bit signed integers)
- String (values are Unicode character strings)
- Zoned DateTime (values are timestamps together with a timeshift for the time zone)

The following OneLake types are supported:

- IntegerType
- LongType
- StringType
- DoubleType
- BooleanType
- FloatType
- ByteType
- ArrayType
- DateType
- TimestampNtzType
- TimestampType

### Data sources

- OneLake parquet and CSV files are the only data sources currently supported.
- Power BI semantic model support is under development.
- Lakehouse with schema enabled isn't supported.

### Edge creation

During graph modeling, give different graph edge types different names.

For example, a social media data set might represent "user likes comment" and "user likes post." If your graph model uses separate node types for *comment* and *post*, then the *user* node type has two types of "likes" edges to *comment* and *post*. You might name these edges *userLikesComment* and *userLikesPost*.

### Graph creation time

Up to once a week, a graph model might encounter a timeout if the graph creation or update takes longer than 20 minutes. The operation is marked as failed.

However, users can reinitiate graph creation or update.

### Total number of graph instances

Each Fabric Workspace can have up to 10 graph instances.

### Size of graph

Creating graphs with more than 500 million nodes and edges might result in unstable performance.

### Multitasking UI

The graph model might disappear or become empty when you switch between tabs or windows in the Fabric multitask UI. The team is actively working to resolve this known problem.

### Node property selection

When you add a node to your graph model, all columns from the source table are added as properties by default. You can remove properties by clicking the trashcan icon. Choosing a custom display label (for example, displaying a name instead of an ID) isn't yet supported.

## Querying

### Number of hops in multihop queries

Graph in Microsoft Fabric currently supports up to eight hops on variable length patterns.

### Size of results

Aggregation performance can be unstable when results exceed 128 MB in size.

The system currently truncates responses that are larger than 64 MB.

### Timeout

Queries time out if they take more than 20 minutes.
