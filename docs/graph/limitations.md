# Select limitations

While Graph in Microsoft Fabric is in preview, the service has certain limitations that users may not have expected. The following highlights some key limitations but does not constitute an exhaustive list. Please check back regularly for updates.

## Creating graph models

#### Data types

Graph in Microsoft Fabric currently only exposes support for the following date types:

- Boolean
- Double (which will be casted to float)
- Integer
- String
- ZonedDateTime

#### Data sources

- OneLake parquet files are the only data sources currently supported.
- Power BI semantic model support is under development.
- LakeHouse with schema enabled is not supported.

#### Edge creation

During graph modeling, different edge types should be given different names.

For example, a social media data set might represent "user likes comment" and "user likes post." If your graph model uses separate node types for *comment* and *post*, then the *user* node type should have two types of "likes" edges to *comment* and *post*; you might name these edges *userLikesComment* and *userLikesPost*.

#### Graph creation time

Up to once a week, a graph model may encounter a timeout if the graph creation or update takes longer than 20 minutes. Such an operation would be marked as failed.Â However, users may re-initiate graph creation or update.

#### Graph instance total number

Up to 10 graph instances are allowed per Fabric Workspace.

#### Size of graph

Creating graphs with more than 500 million nodes and edges may result in unstable performance.

## Querying

#### Number of hops in multi-hop queries

Graph in Microsoft Fabric currently supports up to 8 hops on variable length patterns.

#### Size of results

Aggregation performance may be unstable when results exceed 128 MB in size.
Responses that are larger than 64 MB are currently truncated.

#### Timeout

Queries taking more than 20 minutes will timeout.

## GQL conformance
