# Current Limitations of Graph in Microsoft Fabric

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](./includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

While graph in Microsoft Fabric is in preview, the service has certain functional and performance limitations. The following highlights some key limitations but doesn't constitute an exhaustive list. You should check back regularly for updates.

## Creating graph models

### Data types

Graph in Microsoft Fabric currently only exposes support for the following data types:

- Boolean (values are `true` and `false`)
- Double (values are 64-bit floating point numbers)
- Integer (values are 64-bit signed integers)
- String (values are Unicode character strings)
- Zoned DateTime (values are timestamps together with a timeshift for the time zone)

### Data sources

- OneLake parquet files are the only data sources currently supported.
- Power BI semantic model support is under development.
- Lakehouse with schema enabled isn't supported.

### Edge creation

During graph modeling, different graph edge types should be given different names.

For example, a social media data set might represent "user likes comment" and "user likes post." If your graph model uses separate node types for *comment* and *post*, then the *user* node type should have two types of "likes" edges to *comment* and *post*; you might name these edges *userLikesComment* and *userLikesPost*.

### Graph creation time

Up to once a week, a graph model might encounter a timeout if the graph creation or update takes longer than 20 minutes. Such an operation would be marked as failed.

However, users can reinitiate graph creation or update.

### Graph instance total number

Up to 10 graph instances are allowed per Fabric Workspace.

### Size of graph

Creating graphs with more than 500 million nodes and edges might result in unstable performance.

## Querying

### Number of hops in multi-hop queries

Graph in Microsoft Fabric currently supports up to 8 hops on variable length patterns.

### Size of results

Aggregation performance can be unstable when results exceed 128 MB in size.

Responses that are larger than 64 MB are currently truncated.

### Timeout

Queries taking more than 20 minutes time out.
