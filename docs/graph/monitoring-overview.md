# Monitoring and telemetry for Graph in Microsoft Fabric

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](./includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

Monitoring and telemetry for Graph in Microsoft Fabric follows the existing Fabric-wide telemetry framework. You can use the [Monitoring hub](/fabric/admin/monitoring-hub) to track activities, view historical data, and gain insights into the performance and usage of your Graph workloads. The Monitoring hub provides a centralized location to observe all Fabric activities across your organization, including Graph operations, enabling administrators and users to troubleshoot issues and optimize resource usage.
