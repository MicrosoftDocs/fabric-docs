# Graph in Microsoft Fabric overview

Graph in Microsoft Fabric allows users to integrate and find connected insights across multiple data stores in their organization.

Graph in Microsoft Fabric is an intelligent, scalable solution that transforms disconnected data into AI-powered insights. Unlike relational databases that often require expensive joins and complex queries, graph in Microsoft Fabric models data as nodes and relationships, enabling powerful graph analysis directly from OneLake—without requiring ETL (extract, transform, load) or data replication.​

Integrated AI agents enhance graph reasoning and deliver natural language-driven insights, making it easy for business users, data engineers, and developers to uncover deep, interconnected insights. With a user-friendly low/no-code interface, built-in AI-powered graph algorithms, and seamless integration with Microsoft Fabric, Graph accelerates decision-making and unlocks a new era of AI-enhanced data exploration.

## Why Graph Analytics Matter

Traditional relational and tabular data formats make it difficult—if not impossible—to map relationships between different data points, such as users, posts, comments, forums, and tags. Graph analytics enable you to uncover hidden connections, communities, and influence within your data, making it possible to answer complex questions about social networks, business processes, and more.

Graph in Microsoft Fabric provides an efficient way to model, visualize, and query these relationships, helping you understand the interconnectedness of your data and drive better insights.

- Business User: Visually explores relationships, runs NL queries, and gains insights effortlessly.
- Data Engineer: Defines graph models, unifies data in OneLake with low and no-code tools.
- Data Scientist: Uses graph algorithms and ML (machine learning) in Fabric's Data Science environment.
- Developer: Builds AI agents and real-time apps using graph-powered contextual insights.

Graph in Microsoft Fabric broadens access to graph insights beyond specialized roles. Any user can use connected data in daily decision-making.

## Integration with Microsoft Fabric

Graph in Microsoft Fabric is deeply integrated with the Microsoft Fabric platform, including OneLake for unified data storage and Power BI for visualization. This integration allows seamless access to data, collaboration, and sharing across your organization. The service is designed to work with other Microsoft tools and services, making it easy to incorporate graph analytics into your existing workflows.
