# Example graph datasets

GQL queries given by most documentation articles for Graph in Microsoft Fabric assume one of the following example graphs:

* The *social network example graph* is the primary example graph used in the documentation.
  It's detailed structure is explained in the article on its [schema definition](gql-schema-example.md).

* The *AdventureWorks exmple graph* is explained and used in the [quickstart tutorial](quickstart.md).

The required datasets for these graphs are published in the [Fabric Graph Samples Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/docs-samples/graph).

Please see the [README file](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/docs-samples/graph/README.md) for further instructions on how to obtain and load these datasets.
