# Ontology (preview) tutorial part 5: Conclude and clean up resources

In this tutorial, you created and explored an ontology (preview) item for the Lakeshore Retail ice cream business. You generated entity types such as *Store*, *Products*, and *SaleEvent*. You bound static data from lakehouse tables and time series data, like freezer temperature, from Eventhouse. You explored the data through entity instances, relationship graphs, and natural-language queries. 

[!INCLUDE [Fabric feature-preview-note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

## Clean up resources

When you finish the tutorial, use the steps in this section to delete all the resources you created.

* Delete your Fabric workspace. This action deletes everything inside the workspace, including the sample data lakehouse, eventhouse, optional semantic model, ontology (preview) item and its associated data, and data agent.
