## Choose ontology creation method

This tutorial contains two options for setting up the ontology (preview) item: 
* Automatically [**generate it from a semantic model**](?pivots=semantic-model), or
* Manually [**build it from OneLake data**](?pivots=onelake)

Choose your preferred scenario by using the links above (will reload the page) or the selector at the beginning of the article.
