## Choose ontology creation method

This tutorial contains two options for setting up the ontology (preview) item. Choose from one of the following methods:

* [**Generate from semantic model**](?pivots=semantic-model): With these instructions, you use an existing semantic model to automatically generate an ontology that you can build upon and extend. Choose this option to see how to work with ontology when you already have a well-structured Power BI semantic model that represents your business domain.
* [**Build directly from OneLake**](?pivots=onelake): With these instructions, you create the ontology manually by binding properties directly from OneLake. Choose this option to see how to build an ontology when you don't have a semantic model, or want full control over ontology design from the start.

Choose your preferred scenario by using the links above (will reload the page) or the selector at the beginning of the article.
