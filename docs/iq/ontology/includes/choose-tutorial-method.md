## Choose ontology creation method

This tutorial contains two options for setting up the ontology (preview) item. Choose from one of the following methods:

* [**Generate from semantic model**](?pivots=semantic-model): With these instructions, you use a semantic model of your data to automatically generate an ontology that you can build upon and extend. Choose this option to see how to work with ontology when you already have a well-structured Power BI semantic model that represents your business domain.
* [**Build from scratch**](?pivots=onelake): With these instructions, you create the ontology manually. Choose this option to see how to build an ontology when you don’t have a semantic model or full control over ontology design from the start.

Choose your preferred scenario by using the links above (will reload the page) or the selector at the beginning of the article.
