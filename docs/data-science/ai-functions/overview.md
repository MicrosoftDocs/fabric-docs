# Transform and enrich data seamlessly with AI functions (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

With Microsoft Fabric, all business professionals—from developers to analysts—can derive more value from their enterprise data through Generative AI, using experiences like [Copilot](../../get-started/copilot-notebooks-overview.md) and [Fabric data agents](../how-to-create-data-agent.md). Thanks to a new set of AI functions for data engineering, Fabric users can now harness the power of industry-leading large language models (LLMs) to transform and enrich data seamlessly.

AI functions harness the power of GenAI for summarization, classification, text generation, and so much more—all with a single line of code:

- [**Calculate similarity with `ai.similarity`**](#calculate-similarity-with-aisimilarity): Compare the meaning of input text with a single common text value, or with corresponding text values in another column.
- [**Categorize text with `ai.classify`**](#categorize-text-with-aiclassify): Classify input text values according to labels you choose.
- [**Detect sentiment with `ai.analyze_sentiment`**](#detect-sentiment-with-aianalyze_sentiment): Identify the emotional state expressed by input text.
- [**Extract entities with `ai.extract`**](#extract-entities-with-aiextract): Find and extract specific types of information from input text, for example locations or names.
- [**Fix grammar with `ai.fix_grammar`**](#fix-grammar-with-aifix_grammar): Correct the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of input text.
- [**Summarize text with `ai.summarize`**](#summarize-text-with-aisummarize): Get summaries of input text.
- [**Translate text with `ai.translate`**](#translate-text-with-aitranslate): Translate input text into another language.
- [**Answer custom user prompts with `ai.generate_response`**](#answer-custom-user-prompts-with-aigenerate_response): Generate responses based on your own instructions.

It's seamless to incorporate these functions as part of data-science and data-engineering workflows, whether you're working with pandas or Spark. There is no detailed configuration, no complex infrastructure management, and no specific technical expertise needed.

## Prerequisites

- To use AI functions with Fabric's built-in AI endpoint, your administrator needs to enable [the tenant switch for Copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI](../../admin/service-admin-portal-copilot.md).
- Depending on your location, you may need to enable a tenant setting for cross-geo processing. Learn more [here](../../get-started/copilot-fabric-overview.md#available-regions-for-azure-openai-service).
- You also need an F2 or higher SKU or a P SKU. If you use a trial SKU, you can bring your own Azure Open AI resource.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - AI functions are supported in the [Fabric 1.3 runtime](../../data-engineering/runtime-1-3.md) and higher.
> - AI functions use the **gpt-4o-mini (2024-07-18)** model by default. To learn more about billing and consumption rates, visit [this article](../ai-services/ai-services-overview.md).
> - Most of the AI functions are optimized for use on English-language texts.

## Getting started with AI functions

When working with pandas, the openai package must be installed. In the Python environment, the AI Functions package must also be installed.

No installation is required when working with PySpark, as AI Functions are already preinstalled in the PySpark environment.

The following code cells include all the necessary installation commands.

# [pandas (PySpark environment)](#tab/pandas-pyspark)

```python
# Pandas AI Functions requires openai version 1.30 or higher
%pip install -q --force-reinstall openai==1.30 2>/dev/null

# AI functions are preinstalled on the Fabric PySpark runtime
```

# [pandas (Python environment)](#tab/pandas-python)

```python
# Install fixed version of packages
%pip install -q --force-reinstall openai==1.30 2>/dev/null

# Install latest version of SynapseML-core
%pip install -q --force-reinstall https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/pip/1.0.12-spark3.5/synapseml_core-1.0.12.dev1-py2.py3-none-any.whl 2>/dev/null

# Install SynapseML-Internal .whl with AI functions library from blob storage:
%pip install -q --force-reinstall https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/pip/1.0.12.2-spark3.5/synapseml_internal-1.0.12.2.dev1-py2.py3-none-any.whl 2>/dev/null
```

---

This code cell imports the AI functions library and its dependencies. The pandas cell also imports an optional Python library to display progress bars that track the status of every AI function call.

# [pandas](#tab/pandas)

```python
# Required imports
import synapse.ml.aifunc as aifunc
import pandas as pd
import openai

# Optional import for progress bars
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
tqdm.pandas()
```

# [PySpark](#tab/pyspark)

```python
from synapse.ml.spark.aifunc.DataFrameExtensions import AIFunctions
```

---

## Applying AI functions

Each of the following functions allows you to invoke Fabric's built-in AI endpoint to transform and enrich data with a single line of code. You can use AI functions to analyze pandas DataFrames or Spark DataFrames.

> [!TIP]
> To learn about customizing the configuration of AI functions, visit [this article](./configuration.md).

### Calculate similarity with `ai.similarity`

The `ai.similarity` function invokes AI to compare input text values with a single common text value, or with pairwise text values in another column. The output similarity scores are relative, and they can range from **-1** (opposites) to **1** (identical). A score of **0** indicates that the values are completely unrelated in meaning. For more detailed instructions about the use of `ai.similarity`, visit [this article](./similarity.md).

#### Sample usage

# [pandas](#tab/pandas)

```python
# This code uses AI. Always review output for mistakes. 
# Read terms: https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/

df = pd.DataFrame([ 
        ("Bill Gates", "Microsoft"), 
        ("Satya Nadella", "Toyota"), 
        ("Joan of Arc", "Nike") 
    ], columns=["names", "companies"])
    
df["similarity"] = df["names"].ai.similarity(df["companies"])
display(df)
```

# [PySpark](#tab/pyspark)

```python
# This code uses AI. Always review output for mistakes. 
# Read terms: https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/

df = spark.createDataFrame([
        ("Bill Gates", "Microsoft"), 
        ("Satya Nadella", "Toyota"), 
        ("Joan of Arc", "Nike")
    ], ["names", "companies"])

similarity = df.ai.similarity(input_col="names", other_col="companies", output_col="similarity")
display(similarity)
```

        "Tired of friends judging your baking? With these handy-dandy measuring cups, you'll create culinary delights.",
        "Enjoy this *BRAND NEW CAR!* A compact SUV perfect for the professional commuter!"
    ], columns=["descriptions"])

df["category"] = df['descriptions'].ai.classify("kitchen", "bedroom", "garage", "other")
display(df)
```

### Detect sentiment with `ai.analyze_sentiment`

The `ai.analyze_sentiment` function invokes AI to identify whether the emotional state expressed by input text is positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. If AI can't make this determination, the output is left blank. For more detailed instructions about the use of `ai.analyze_sentiment`, visit [this article](./analyze-sentiment.md).

        "I used this sunscreen on my vacation to Florida, and I didn't get burned at all. Would recommend.",
        "I'm torn about this speaker system. The sound was high quality, though it didn't connect to my roommate's phone.",
        "The umbrella is OK, I guess."
    ], columns=["reviews"])

df["sentiment"] = df["reviews"].ai.analyze_sentiment()
