# Transform and enrich data with AI functions (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

Microsoft Fabric AI Functions enable all business professionals (from developers to analysts) to transform and enrich their enterprise data using generative AI.

AI functions use industry-leading large language models (LLMs) for summarization, classification, text generation, and more. With a single line of code, you can:

- [`ai.analyze_sentiment`](#detect-sentiment-with-aianalyze_sentiment): Detect the emotional state of input text.
- [`ai.classify`](#categorize-text-with-aiclassify): Categorize input text according to your labels.
- [`ai.extract`](#extract-entities-with-aiextract): Extract specific types of information from input text (e.g., locations or names).
- [`ai.fix_grammar`](#fix-grammar-with-aifix_grammar): Correct the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of input text.
- [`ai.generate_response`](#answer-custom-user-prompts-with-aigenerate_response): Generate responses based on your own instructions.
- [`ai.similarity`](#calculate-similarity-with-aisimilarity): Compare the meaning of input text with a single text value, or with text in another column.
- [`ai.summarize`](#summarize-text-with-aisummarize): Get summaries of input text.
- [`ai.translate`](#translate-text-with-aitranslate): Translate input text into another language.

You can incorporate these functions as part of data science and data engineering workflows, whether you're working with pandas or Spark. There's no detailed configuration and no complex infrastructure management. You don't need any specific technical expertise.

## Prerequisites

- To use AI functions with the built-in AI endpoint in Fabric, your administrator needs to enable [the tenant switch for Copilot and other features that are powered by Azure OpenAI](../../admin/service-admin-portal-copilot.md).
- Depending on your location, you might need to enable a tenant setting for cross-geo processing. Learn more about [available regions for Azure OpenAI Service](../../get-started/copilot-fabric-overview.md#available-regions-for-azure-openai-service).
- You need a paid Fabric capacity (F2 or higher, or any P edition). Bring-your-own Azure OpenAI resources aren't supported on the Fabric trial edition.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - AI functions are supported in [Fabric Runtime 1.3](../../data-engineering/runtime-1-3.md) and later.
 > - Unless you configure a different model, AI functions default to *gpt-4.1-mini*. Learn more about [billing and consumption rates](../ai-services/ai-services-overview.md).
> - Although the underlying model can handle several languages, most of the AI functions are optimized for use on English-language texts."

## Getting started with AI functions

AI Functions can be used with pandas (Python and PySpark runtimes), and with PySpark (PySpark runtime). The required installation and import steps for each are outlined below, followed by the corresponding commands.

### Install dependencies

- Pandas (Python runtime) 
  - `synapseml_internal` and `synapseml_core` whl files installation required (commands provided below)
  - `openai` package installation required (command provided below)
- Pandas (PySpark runtime)
  - `openai` package installation required (command provided below)
- PySpark (PySpark runtime)
  - No installation required

# [pandas (PySpark runtime)](#tab/pandas-pyspark)

```python
# The pandas AI functions package requires OpenAI version 1.99.5 or later
%pip install -q --force-reinstall openai==1.99.5 2>/dev/null

# AI functions are preinstalled on the Fabric PySpark runtime
```

# [pandas (Python runtime)](#tab/pandas-python)

```python
# Install latest versions of AI functions library whl
!wget -q https://aka.ms/fabric-aifunctions-whl -O synapseml_internal-latest-py3-none-any.whl
!wget -q https://aka.ms/fabric-synapseml-core-whl -O synapseml_core-latest-py3-none-any.whl

# The pandas AI functions package requires OpenAI version 1.99.5 or later
%pip install -q --force-reinstall openai==1.99.5 synapseml_internal-latest-py3-none-any.whl synapseml_core-latest-py3-none-any.whl

```

---

### Import required libraries

The following code cell imports the AI functions library and its dependencies.

# [pandas](#tab/pandas)

```python
# Required imports
import synapse.ml.aifunc as aifunc
import pandas as pd
```

# [PySpark](#tab/pyspark)

```python
import synapse.ml.spark.aifunc as aifunc

# SparkSession with accessor `spark` in PySpark environments is pre-setup and available for use
```

---

## Apply AI functions

Each of the following functions allows you to invoke the built-in AI endpoint in Fabric to transform and enrich data with a single line of code. You can use AI functions to analyze pandas DataFrames or Spark DataFrames.

> [!TIP]
> Learn how to [customize the configuration](./pandas/configuration.md) of AI functions.

### Detect sentiment with ai.analyze_sentiment

The `ai.analyze_sentiment` function invokes AI to identify whether the emotional state expressed by input text is positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. If AI can't make this determination, the output is left blank. For more detailed instructions about the use of `ai.analyze_sentiment` with pandas, see [this article](./pandas/analyze-sentiment.md). For `ai.analyze_sentiment` with PySpark, see [this article](./pyspark/analyze-sentiment.md).

        "I used this sunscreen on my vacation to Florida, and I didn't get burned at all. Would recommend.",
        "I'm torn about this speaker system. The sound was high quality, though it didn't connect to my roommate's phone.",
        "The umbrella is OK, I guess."
    ], columns=["reviews"])

df["sentiment"] = df["reviews"].ai.analyze_sentiment()

### Answer custom user prompts with ai.generate_response

The `ai.generate_response` function invokes AI to generate custom text based on your own instructions. For more detailed instructions about the use of `ai.generate_response` with pandas, see [this article](./pandas/generate-response.md). For `ai.generate_response` with PySpark, see [this article](./pyspark/generate-response.md).

### Calculate similarity with ai.similarity

The `ai.similarity` function compares each input text value either to one common reference text or to the corresponding value in another column (pairwise mode). The output similarity score values are relative, and they can range from `-1` (opposites) to `1` (identical). A score of `0` indicates that the values are unrelated in meaning. For more detailed instructions about the use of `ai.similarity` with pandas, see [thi article](./pandas/similarity.md). For `ai.similarity` with PySpark, see [this article](./pyspark/similarity.md).

### Summarize text with ai.summarize

The `ai.summarize` function invokes AI to generate summaries of input text (either values from a single column of a DataFrame, or row values across all the columns). For more detailed instructions about the use of `ai.summarize` with pandas, see [this article](./pandas/summarize.md). For `ai.summarize` with PySpark, see [this article](./pyspark/summarize.md).
