If you want to open the accompanying notebook for this tutorial, follow the instructions in [Prepare your system for data science](../tutorial-data-science-prepare-system.md#import-tutorial-notebooks) to import the tutorial notebooks to your workspace.  

Or, [create a new notebook](../../data-engineering/how-to-use-notebook.md#create-notebooks) if you'd rather copy and paste the code from this page.

Be sure to [attach a lakehouse to the notebook](../tutorial-data-science-prepare-system.md#attach-a-lakehouse-to-the-notebooks) before you start running code.
