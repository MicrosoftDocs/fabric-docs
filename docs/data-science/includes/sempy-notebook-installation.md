For Spark 3.4 and above, Semantic link is available in the default runtime when using Fabric, and there's no need to install it. If you're using Spark 3.3 or below, or if you want to update to the most recent version of Semantic Link, you can run the command:

` ` ` python
%pip install -U semantic-link
` ` `
