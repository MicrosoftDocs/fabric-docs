# Use Azure OpenAI in Fabric with REST API (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]
This document shows examples of how to use Azure OpenAI in Fabric using REST API.

## Chat

ChatGPT and GPT-4 are language models optimized for conversational interfaces. To access Azure OpenAI chat endpoints in Fabric, you can send an API request using the following format:

`POST <prebuilt_AI_base_url>/openai/deployments/<deployment_name>/chat/completions?api-version=2023-03-15-preview`

`deployment_name` could be one of:

-   `gpt-35-turbo`
-   `gpt-35-turbo-16k`

### Initialization

You can initialize the process by providing some necessary parameters. These parameters include the `Capacity ID`, `Workspace ID`, and User `AAD Token`, which can be obtained using the `mlflow-plugin` to create the base endpoint for Azure OpenAI models. 

Additionally, the `x-ms-upstream-artifact-id` is the ID of the artifact that is being used and consumed for billing purposes, and the `x-ms-llm-feature-name` is the feature name that is used to track usage and configure the request rate limit. 

``` python
from synapse.ml.mlflow import get_mlflow_env_config

mlflow_env_configs = get_mlflow_env_config()
access_token = mlflow_env_configs.driver_aad_token

prebuilt_AI_base_url = mlflow_env_configs.workload_endpoint + "cognitive/openai/"
print("workload endpoint for OpenAI: \n" + prebuilt_AI_base_url)

deployment_name = "gpt-35-turbo" # deployment name could be `gpt-35-turbo` or `gpt-35-turbo-16k`
openai_url = prebuilt_AI_base_url + f"openai/deployments/{deployment_name}/chat/completions?api-version=2023-03-15-preview"
print("The full uri of ChatGPT is: ", openai_url)

post_headers = {
    "Content-Type" : "application/json",
    "Authorization" : "Bearer {}".format(access_token)
}
```


``` python
import requests

def printresult(openai_url:str, response_code:int, messages:list, result:str):

    bot_msg_box = list(map(lambda x : {"role":"assistant", "content":x}, bot_msg_box))
    
    # cross merge two lists
    msgs = [msg for msgs in zip(user_msg_box, bot_msg_box) for msg in msgs]
    if len(user_msg_box) > len(bot_msg_box):
        msgs.extend(user_msg_box[len(bot_msg_box):])
    elif len(user_msg_box) < len(bot_msg_box):
        msgs.extend(bot_msg_box[len(user_msg_box):])

    # add system msg in front of message box
    msgs.insert(0, system_msg)
    
    # request ChatGPT and analysis response
    post_body = { "messages" : msgs }
    response = requests.post(openai_url, headers=post_headers, json=post_body)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    else:
        result = response.content
    return response.status_code, post_body, result
```


### AI Assistant

OpenAI input:

```
    [System] You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
    Q: Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?
```
OpenAI output:

### IT Architect helper

OpenAI input:

```
    [System] You are an IT Architect. I will provide some details about the functionality of an application or other digital product, and it will be your job to come up with ways to integrate it into the IT landscape. This could involve analyzing business requirements, performing a gap analysis and mapping the functionality of the new system to the existing IT landscape. Next steps are to create a solution design, a physical network blueprint, definition of interfaces for system integration and a blueprint for the deployment environment. 
    A: I need help to integrate a CMS system.
```

OpenAI output:

```
    A: Sure, I can help you integrate a CMS system. Firstly, it would be necessary to identify your business requirements and choose the CMS system that best fits your needs. Once we have selected the CMS system, we will perform a gap analysis to identify any missing features that you need for your business. 
       Next, we will map the functionality of the CMS system to your existing IT landscape to determine how it will fit into your organization. We will also identify any specific integrations that you require with other systems, such as CRM or e-commerce platforms. 
       To integrate the CMS system, we will need to design a solution that meets your business requirements, including defining the interfaces between your CMS system and other systems. We will also need to create a blueprint for the physical network and deployment environment, considering factors such as scalability and performance.
       Once we have a comprehensive design and blueprint in place, we can begin the deployment of the CMS system. We will work with your team to configure the CMS system, install any necessary plugins or extensions, and perform any required testing or migration of your existing content.
       Finally, we will provide training and support for your organization to help you get the most out of your new CMS system.

```
``` python
system_message = "You are an IT Architect. I will provide some details about the functionality of an application or other digital product, and it will be your job to come up with ways to integrate it into the IT landscape. This could involve analyzing business requirements, performing a gap analysis and mapping the functionality of the new system to the existing IT landscape. Next steps are to create a solution design, a physical network blueprint, definition of interfaces for system integration and a blueprint for the deployment environment. "
user_message_box = ["I need help to integrate a CMS system."]
bot_message_box = []

printresult(openai_url, status_code, post_body["messages"], result)
```


### Shakespeare Writing Assistant

OpenAI input:

```
    [System] You are a Shakespearean writing assistant who speaks in a Shakespearean style. You help people come up with creative ideas and content like stories, poems, and songs that use Shakespearean style of writing style, including words like "thou" and "hath".
    Here are some example of Shakespeare's style:
     - Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
     - Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
     - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
    Q: Please write a short text turning down an invitation to dinner.
    A: Dearest,
       Regretfully, I must decline thy invitation.
       Prior engagements call me hence. Apologies.
    Q: Add more details.
```

OpenAI output:

```
    A: Fairly well,
       Thy gracious invitation to dine hath filled my heart with gladness. Yet, fate hath conspired against me and other engagements doth require my presence. 
       Pray, accept my regrets and know that I am nigh as sad as thou must be. Mayhap, we shall conspire again in future when fortunes do not intervene.
       With deepest respect, 

```
``` python
system_message = "You are a Shakespearean writing assistant who speaks in a Shakespearean style. You help people come up with creative ideas and content like stories, poems, and songs that use Shakespearean style of writing style, including words like \"thou\" and \"hath".\nHere are some example of Shakespeare's style:\n - Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?\n - Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\n - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate."

## Completions

The completions endpoint can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It provides a simple but powerful text-in, text-out interface to any of our models. You input some text as a prompt, and the model generates a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it. For example, if you give the API the prompt, "As Descartes said, I think, therefore", it returns the completion " I am" with high probability.

To access Azure OpenAI completions endpoints in Fabric, you can send an API request using the following format:

`POST <url_prefix>/openai/deployments/<deployment_name>/completions?api-version=2022-12-01`

`deployment_name` could be one of:

-   `text-davinci-003`
-   `code-cushman-002`

    A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich.[1] Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars, and strange stars.[2] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.[3] They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.


    Tl;dr
```
OpenAI output:
```
    A neutron star is the collapsed core of a star that has undergone a supernova. These ultra-dense objects are incredibly fascinating due to their strange properties and the potential for phenomena such as extreme gravitational forces and a strong magnetic field.

## Embeddings
An embedding is a special data representation format that machine learning models and algorithms can easily utilize. It contains information-rich semantic meaning of a text, represented by a vector of floating point numbers. The distance between two embeddings in the vector space is related to the semantic similarity between two original inputs. For example, if two texts are similar, their vector representations should also be similar.

To access Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint in Fabric, you can send an API request using the following format:

```POST <url_prefix>/openai/deployments/<deployment_name>/embeddings?api-version=2022-12-01```

`deployment_name` could be `text-embedding-ada-002`.

### Initialization

``` python
from synapse.ml.mlflow import get_mlflow_env_config

mlflow_env_configs = get_mlflow_env_config()
access_token = mlflow_env_configs.driver_aad_token

prebuilt_AI_base_url = mlflow_env_configs.workload_endpoint + "cognitive/openai/"
print("workload endpoint for OpenAI: \n" + prebuilt_AI_base_url)

deployment_name = "text-embedding-ada-002"
openai_url = prebuilt_AI_base_url + f"openai/deployments/{deployment_name}/embeddings?api-version=2022-12-01"
print("The full uri of Embeddings is: ", openai_url)

post_headers = {
    "Content-Type" : "application/json",
    "Authorization" : "Bearer {}".format(access_token)
}

post_body = {
    "input": "empty prompt, need to fill in the content before the request",
}
```

``` python
import json
import uuid
import requests
from pprint import pprint


def printresult(openai_url:str, response_code:int, prompt:str, result:str):
    print("==========================================================================================")
    print("| Post URI        |", openai_url)
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("| Response Status |", response_code)
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("| OpenAI Input    |\n", prompt)
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("| OpenAI Output   |\n", result)
    print("==========================================================================================")

```

### Get Embeddings

OpenAI input:
```
John is good boy.
```

OpenAI output:
```
[-0.0045386623, 0.0031397594, ..., 0.0006536394, -0.037461143, -0.033455864]
```

``` python
input_words = "John is good boy."
post_body["input"] = input_words
response = requests.post(url=openai_url, headers=post_headers, json=post_body)
printresult(openai_url=openai_url, response_code=response.status_code, prompt=input_words, result=response.content)
```
