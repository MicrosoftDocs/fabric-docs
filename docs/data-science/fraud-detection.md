# Tutorial: Create, evaluate, and score a fraud detection model

This tutorial presents an end-to-end example of a [!INCLUDE [fabric-ds-name](includes/fabric-ds-name.md)] workflow, in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]. The scenario builds a fraud detection model with machine learning algorithms trained on historical data. It then uses the model to detect future fraudulent transactions.

This tutorial covers these steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Install custom libraries
> * Load the data
> * Understand and process the data through exploratory data analysis
> * Use scikit-learn to train a machine learning model, and track experiments with the MLflow and Fabric Autologging features
> * Save and register the machine learning model that has the highest performance
> * Load the machine learning model for scoring and to make predictions

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites](./includes/prerequisites.md)]

* If necessary, create a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse as described in [Create a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric](../data-engineering/create-lakehouse.md).

## Follow along in a notebook

You can choose one of these options to follow along in a notebook:

- Open and run the built-in notebook.
- Upload your notebook from GitHub.

### Open the built-in notebook

The sample **Fraud detection** notebook accompanies this tutorial.

[!INCLUDE [follow-along-built-in-notebook](includes/follow-along-built-in-notebook.md)]

### Import the notebook from GitHub

The [AIsample - Fraud Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/data-science/ai-samples/python/AIsample%20-%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb) notebook accompanies this tutorial.

## Step 1: Install custom libraries

For machine learning model development or ad-hoc data analysis, you might need to quickly install a custom library for your Apache Spark session. You have two options to install libraries.

* Use the inline installation capabilities (`%pip` or `%conda`) of your notebook to install a library, in your current notebook only.
* Alternatively, you can create a Fabric environment, install libraries from public sources or upload custom libraries to it, and then your workspace admin can attach the environment as the default for the workspace. All the libraries in the environment will then become available for use in any notebooks and Spark job definitions in the workspace. For more information on environments, see [create, configure, and use an environment in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabric/create-environment).

For this tutorial, use `%pip install` to install the `imblearn` library in your notebook. 

> [!NOTE]
> The PySpark kernel restarts after `%pip install` runs. Install the needed libraries before you run any other cells.

```python
# Use pip to install imblearn
%pip install imblearn
```

## Step 2: Load the data

The fraud detection dataset contains credit card transactions, from September 2013, that European cardholders made over the course of two days. The dataset contains only numerical features because of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation applied to the original features. PCA transformed all features except for `Time` and `Amount`. To protect confidentiality, we can't provide the original features or more background information about the dataset.

These details describe the dataset:

- The `V1`, `V2`, `V3`, â€¦, `V28` features are the principal components obtained with PCA
- The `Time` feature contains the elapsed seconds between a transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
- The `Amount` feature is the transaction amount. You can use this feature for example-dependent, cost-sensitive learning
- The `Class` column is the response (target) variable. It has the value `1` for fraud, and `0` otherwise

Only 492 transactions, out of 284,807 transactions total, are fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, because the minority (fraudulent) class accounts for only about 0.172% of the data.

This table shows a preview of the *creditcard.csv* data:

|Time|V1|V2|V3|V4|V5|V6|V7|V8|V9|V10|V11|V12|V13|V14|V15|V16|V17|V18|V19|V20|V21|V22|V23|V24|V25|V26|V27|V28|Amount|Class|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|-1.3598071336738|-0.0727811733098497|2.53634673796914|1.37815522427443|-0.338320769942518|0.462387777762292|0.239598554061257|0.0986979012610507|0.363786969611213|0.0907941719789316|-0.551599533260813|-0.617800855762348|-0.991389847235408|-0.311169353699879|1.46817697209427|-0.470400525259478|0.207971241929242|0.0257905801985591|0.403992960255733|0.251412098239705|-0.018306777944153|0.277837575558899|-0.110473910188767|0.0669280749146731|0.128539358273528|-0.189114843888824|0.133558376740387|-0.0210530534538215|149.62|"0"|

### Download the dataset and upload to the lakehouse

Define these parameters, so that you can use this notebook with different datasets:

```python
IS_CUSTOM_DATA = False  # If True, the dataset has to be uploaded manually

TARGET_COL = "Class"  # Target column name
IS_SAMPLE = False  # If True, use only <SAMPLE_ROWS> rows of data for training; otherwise, use all data
SAMPLE_ROWS = 5000  # If IS_SAMPLE is True, use only this number of rows for training

DATA_FOLDER = "Files/fraud-detection/"  # Folder with data files
DATA_FILE = "creditcard.csv"  # Data file name

EXPERIMENT_NAME = "aisample-fraud"  # MLflow experiment name
```

This code downloads a publicly available version of the dataset, and then stores it in a Fabric lakehouse.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to [add a lakehouse](https://aka.ms/fabric/addlakehouse) to the notebook before you run it. Otherwise, you'll get an error.

```python
if not IS_CUSTOM_DATA:
    # Download data files into the lakehouse if they're not already there
    import os, requests

    remote_url = "https://synapseaisolutionsa.z13.web.core.windows.net/data/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection"
    fname = "creditcard.csv"
    download_path = f"/lakehouse/default/{DATA_FOLDER}/raw"

    if not os.path.exists("/lakehouse/default"):
        raise FileNotFoundError("Default lakehouse not found, please add a lakehouse and restart the session.")
    os.makedirs(download_path, exist_ok=True)
    if not os.path.exists(f"{download_path}/{fname}"):
        r = requests.get(f"{remote_url}/{fname}", timeout=30)
        with open(f"{download_path}/{fname}", "wb") as f:
            f.write(r.content)
    print("Downloaded demo data files into lakehouse.")
```

### Set up MLflow experiment tracking

The experiment tracking process saves all relevant experiment-related information for every experiment that you run. Sometimes, you have no way to obtain better results when you run a specific experiment. In those cases, you should stop the experiment and try a new one.

The Synapse Data Science experience in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] includes an autologging feature. This feature reduces the amount of code needed to automatically log the parameters, metrics, and items of a machine learning model during training. The feature extends the MLflow autologging capabilities. It has deep integration in the Data Science experience.

With autologging, you can easily track and compare the performance of different models and experiments, without the need for manual tracking. For more information, see [Autologging in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabric-autologging).

To disable Microsoft Fabric autologging in a notebook session, call `mlflow.autolog()` and set `disable=True`:

```python
# Set up MLflow for experiment tracking
import mlflow

mlflow.set_experiment(EXPERIMENT_NAME)
mlflow.autolog(disable=True)  # Disable MLflow autologging
```

### Read raw data from the lakehouse

This code reads raw data from the lakehouse:

```python
df = (
    spark.read.format("csv")
    .option("header", "true")
    .option("inferSchema", True)
    .load(f"{DATA_FOLDER}/raw/{DATA_FILE}")
    .cache()
)
```

## Step 3: Perform exploratory data analysis

In this section, you first explore the raw data and high-level statistics. Then, to transform the data, cast the columns into the correct types, and convert them from the Spark DataFrame into a pandas DataFrame for easier visualization. Finally, you explore and visualize the class distributions in the data.

### Display the raw data

1. Explore the raw data, and view high-level statistics, with the `display` command. For more information about data visualization, see [Notebook visualization in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabric/visualization).

    ```python
    display(df)
    ```

1. Print some basic information about the dataset:

    ```python
    # Print dataset basic information
    print("records read: " + str(df.count()))
    print("Schema: ")
    df.printSchema()
    ```

### Transform the data

1. Cast the dataset columns into the correct types:

    ```python
    import pyspark.sql.functions as F
    
    df_columns = df.columns
    df_columns.remove(TARGET_COL)
    
    # Ensure that TARGET_COL is the last column
    df = df.select(df_columns + [TARGET_COL]).withColumn(TARGET_COL, F.col(TARGET_COL).cast("int"))
    
    if IS_SAMPLE:
        df = df.limit(SAMPLE_ROWS)
    ```

1. Convert the Spark DataFrame to a pandas DataFrame for easier visualization and processing:

    ```python
    df_pd = df.toPandas()
    ```

### Explore the class distribution in the dataset

1. Display the class distribution in the dataset:

    ```python
    # The distribution of classes in the dataset
    print('No Frauds', round(df_pd['Class'].value_counts()[0]/len(df_pd) * 100,2), '% of the dataset')
    print('Frauds', round(df_pd['Class'].value_counts()[1]/len(df_pd) * 100,2), '% of the dataset')
    ```

    The code returns this dataset class distribution: 99.83% `No Frauds` and 0.17% `Frauds`. This class distribution shows that most of the transactions are nonfraudulent. Therefore, data preprocessing is required before model training, to avoid overfitting.

1. Use a plot to show the class imbalance in the dataset, by viewing the distribution of fraudulent versus nonfraudulent transactions:

    ```python
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    colors = ["#0101DF", "#DF0101"]
    sns.countplot(x='Class', data=df_pd, palette=colors) 
    plt.title('Class Distributions \n (0: No Fraud || 1: Fraud)', fontsize=10)
    ```

1. Show the five-number summary (minimum score, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum score) for the transaction amount, with box plots:

    ```python
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(12,5))
    s = sns.boxplot(ax = ax1, x="Class", y="Amount", hue="Class",data=df_pd, palette="PRGn", showfliers=True) # Remove outliers from the plot
    s = sns.boxplot(ax = ax2, x="Class", y="Amount", hue="Class",data=df_pd, palette="PRGn", showfliers=False) # Keep outliers from the plot
    plt.show()
    ```

    For highly imbalanced data, box plots might not show accurate insights. However, you can address the `Class` imbalance problem first, and then create the same plots for more accurate insights.

## Step 4: Train and evaluate the models

Here, you train a LightGBM model to classify the fraud transactions. You train a LightGBM model on both the imbalanced dataset and the balanced dataset. Then, you compare the performance of both models.

### Prepare training and test datasets

Before training, split the data into the training and test datasets:

```python
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train, test = train_test_split(df_pd, test_size=0.15)
feature_cols = [c for c in df_pd.columns.tolist() if c not in [TARGET_COL]]
```

### Apply SMOTE to the training dataset

The `imblearn` library uses the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) approach to address the problem of imbalanced classification. Imbalanced classification happens when too few examples of the minority class are available, for a model to effectively learn the decision boundary. SMOTE is the most widely used approach to synthesize new samples for the minority class.

Apply SMOTE only to the training dataset, instead of the test dataset. When you score the model with the test data, you need an approximation of the model performance on unseen data in production. For a valid approximation, your test data relies on the original imbalanced distribution to represent production data as closely as possible.

```python
# Apply SMOTE to the training data
import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

X = train[feature_cols]
y = train[TARGET_COL]
print("Original dataset shape %s" % Counter(y))

sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X, y)
print("Resampled dataset shape %s" % Counter(y_res))

new_train = pd.concat([X_res, y_res], axis=1)
```

For more information about SMOTE, see the [scikit-learn reference page for the SMOTE method](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html) and the [scikit-learn user guide on oversampling](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/over_sampling.html#smote-adasyn) resources.

### Train machine learning models and run experiments

Apache Spark, in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], enables machine learning with big data. With Apache Spark, you can get valuable insights from large amounts of structured, unstructured, and fast-moving data.

You have several available options to train machine learning models with Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric: Apache Spark MLlib, SynapseML, and other open-source libraries. For more information, see [Train machine learning models in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabric/MLTrain).

A *machine learning experiment* serves as the primary unit of organization and control for all related machine learning runs. A *run* corresponds to a single execution of model code. Machine learning *experiment tracking* involves the management of all the experiments and their components, such as parameters, metrics, models, and other artifacts.

For experiment tracking, you can organize all the required components of a specific machine learning experiment. Additionally, you can easily reproduce past results with saved experiments. For more information about machine learning experiments, see [Machine learning experiments in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/synapse-experiment).

1. To track more metrics, parameters, and files, set `exclusive=False` to update the MLflow autologging configuration:

    ```python
    mlflow.autolog(exclusive=False)
    ```

1. Train two models with LightGBM. One model handles the imbalanced dataset, and the other model handles the balanced dataset (via SMOTE). Then compare the performance of the two models.

    ```python
    import lightgbm as lgb
    
    model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(objective="binary") # Imbalanced dataset
    smote_model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(objective="binary") # Balanced dataset
    ```

    ```python
    # Train LightGBM for both imbalanced and balanced datasets and define the evaluation metrics
    print("Start training with imbalanced data:\n")
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="raw_data") as raw_run:
        model = model.fit(
            train[feature_cols],
            train[TARGET_COL],
            eval_set=[(test[feature_cols], test[TARGET_COL])],
            eval_metric="auc",
            callbacks=[
                lgb.log_evaluation(10),
            ],
        )
    
    print(f"\n\nStart training with balanced data:\n")
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="smote_data") as smote_run:
        smote_model = smote_model.fit(
            new_train[feature_cols],
            new_train[TARGET_COL],
            eval_set=[(test[feature_cols], test[TARGET_COL])],
            eval_metric="auc",
            callbacks=[
                lgb.log_evaluation(10),
            ],
        )
    ```

### Determine feature importance for training

1. Determine feature importance for the model that you trained on the imbalanced dataset:

    ```python
    with mlflow.start_run(run_id=raw_run.info.run_id):
        importance = lgb.plot_importance(
            model, title="Feature importance for imbalanced data"
        )
        importance.figure.savefig("feauture_importance.png")
        mlflow.log_figure(importance.figure, "feature_importance.png")
    ```

1. Determine feature importance for the model that you trained on balanced data. SMOTE generated the balanced data:

    ```python
    with mlflow.start_run(run_id=smote_run.info.run_id):
        smote_importance = lgb.plot_importance(
            smote_model, title="Feature importance for balanced (via SMOTE) data"
        )
        smote_importance.figure.savefig("feauture_importance_smote.png")
        mlflow.log_figure(smote_importance.figure, "feauture_importance_smote.png")
    ```

To train a model with the imbalanced dataset, the important features have significant differences when compared with a model trained with the balanced dataset.

### Evaluate the models

Here, you evaluate the two trained models:

- `model` trained on raw, imbalanced data
- `smote_model` trained on balanced data

#### Compute model metrics

1. Define a `prediction_to_spark` function that performs predictions, and converts the prediction results into a Spark DataFrame. You can then compute model statistics on the prediction results with [SynapseML](https://aka.ms/fabric/SynapseEval).

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import col
    from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, DoubleType
    
    def prediction_to_spark(model, test):
        predictions = model.predict(test[feature_cols], num_iteration=model.best_iteration_)
        predictions = tuple(zip(test[TARGET_COL].tolist(), predictions.tolist()))
        dataColumns = [TARGET_COL, "prediction"]
        predictions = (
            spark.createDataFrame(data=predictions, schema=dataColumns)
            .withColumn(TARGET_COL, col(TARGET_COL).cast(IntegerType()))
            .withColumn("prediction", col("prediction").cast(DoubleType()))
        )
    
        return predictions
    ```

1. Use the `prediction_to_spark` function to perform predictions with the two models, `model` and `smote_model`:

    ```python
    predictions = prediction_to_spark(model, test)
    smote_predictions = prediction_to_spark(smote_model, test)
    predictions.limit(10).toPandas()
    ```

1. Compute metrics for the two models:

    ```python
    from synapse.ml.train import ComputeModelStatistics
    
    metrics = ComputeModelStatistics(
        evaluationMetric="classification", labelCol=TARGET_COL, scoredLabelsCol="prediction"
    ).transform(predictions)
    
    smote_metrics = ComputeModelStatistics(
        evaluationMetric="classification", labelCol=TARGET_COL, scoredLabelsCol="prediction"
    ).transform(smote_predictions)
    display(metrics)
    ```

#### Evaluate model performance with a confusion matrix

A *confusion matrix* displays the number of

* true positives (TP)
* true negatives (TN)
* false positives (FP)
* false negatives (FN)

that a model produces when scored with test data. For binary classification, the model returns a `2x2` confusion matrix. For multiclass classification, the model returns an `nxn` confusion matrix, where `n` is the number of classes.

1. Use a confusion matrix to summarize the performances of the trained machine learning models on the test data:

    ```python
    # Collect confusion matrix values
    cm = metrics.select("confusion_matrix").collect()[0][0].toArray()
    smote_cm = smote_metrics.select("confusion_matrix").collect()[0][0].toArray()
    print(cm)
    ```

1. Plot the confusion matrix for the predictions of `smote_model` (trained on balanced data):

    ```python
    # Plot the confusion matrix
    import seaborn as sns
    
    def plot(cm):
        """
        Plot the confusion matrix.
        """
        sns.set(rc={"figure.figsize": (5, 3.5)})
        ax = sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt=".20g")
        ax.set_title("Confusion Matrix")
        ax.set_xlabel("Predicted label")
        ax.set_ylabel("True label")
        return ax
    
    with mlflow.start_run(run_id=smote_run.info.run_id):
        ax = plot(smote_cm)
        mlflow.log_figure(ax.figure, "ConfusionMatrix.png")
    ```

1. Plot the confusion matrix for the predictions of `model` (trained on raw, imbalanced data):

    ```python
    with mlflow.start_run(run_id=raw_run.info.run_id):
        ax = plot(cm)
        mlflow.log_figure(ax.figure, "ConfusionMatrix.png")
    ```

#### Evaluate model performance with AUC-ROC and AUPRC measures

The Area Under the Curve Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) measure assesses the performance of binary classifiers. The AUC-ROC chart visualizes the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR).

In some cases, it's more appropriate to evaluate your classifier based on the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) measure. The AUPRC curve combines these rates:

- The precision, or the positive predictive value (PPV)
- The recall, or TPR

To evaluate performance with the AUC-ROC and AUPRC measures:

1. Define a function that returns the AUC-ROC and AUPRC measures:

    ```python
    from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator
    
    def evaluate(predictions):
        """
        Evaluate the model by computing AUROC and AUPRC with the predictions.
        """
    
        # Initialize the binary evaluator
        evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(rawPredictionCol="prediction", labelCol=TARGET_COL)
    
        _evaluator = lambda metric: evaluator.setMetricName(metric).evaluate(predictions)
    
        # Calculate AUROC, baseline 0.5
        auroc = _evaluator("areaUnderROC")
        print(f"The AUROC is: {auroc:.4f}")
    
        # Calculate AUPRC, baseline positive rate (0.172% in the data)
        auprc = _evaluator("areaUnderPR")
        print(f"The AUPRC is: {auprc:.4f}")
    
        return auroc, auprc    
    ```

1. Log the AUC-ROC and AUPRC metrics for the model that you trained on imbalanced data:

    ```python
    with mlflow.start_run(run_id=raw_run.info.run_id):
        auroc, auprc = evaluate(predictions)
        mlflow.log_metrics({"AUPRC": auprc, "AUROC": auroc})
        mlflow.log_params({"Data_Enhancement": "None", "DATA_FILE": DATA_FILE})
    ```

1. Log the AUC-ROC and AUPRC metrics for the model that you trained on balanced data:

    ```python
    with mlflow.start_run(run_id=smote_run.info.run_id):
        auroc, auprc = evaluate(smote_predictions)
        mlflow.log_metrics({"AUPRC": auprc, "AUROC": auroc})
        mlflow.log_params({"Data_Enhancement": "SMOTE", "DATA_FILE": DATA_FILE})
    ```

The model trained on the balanced data returns higher AUC-ROC and AUPRC values compared to the model trained on the imbalanced data. Based on these measures, SMOTE seems like an effective technique to enhance model performance when working with highly imbalanced data.

As the next image shows, any experiment is logged with its respective name. You can track the experiment parameters and performance metrics in your workspace.

This image shows the performance metrics for the model trained on the balanced dataset (in **Version 2**):

:::image type="content" source="media/fraud-detection/fraud-detection-model-mlflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of logged model performance metrics and model parameters." lightbox="media/fraud-detection/fraud-detection-model-mlflow.png":::

You can select **Version 1** to see the metrics for the model trained on the imbalanced dataset. When you compare the metrics, the AUROC is higher for the model trained with the balanced dataset. These results indicate that this model is better at correctly predicting `0` classes as `0`, and predicting `1` classes as `1`.

## Step 5: Register the models

Use MLflow to register the two models:

```python
# Register the model
registered_model_name = f"{EXPERIMENT_NAME}-lightgbm"

raw_model_uri = "runs:/{}/model".format(raw_run.info.run_id)
mlflow.register_model(raw_model_uri, registered_model_name)

smote_model_uri = "runs:/{}/model".format(smote_run.info.run_id)
mlflow.register_model(smote_model_uri, registered_model_name)
```

## Step 6: Save the prediction results

Microsoft Fabric allows users to operationalize machine learning models with the `PREDICT` scalable function. This function supports batch scoring (or batch inferencing) in any compute engine.

You can generate batch predictions directly from the Microsoft Fabric notebook or from a model's item page. For more information about `PREDICT`, see [Model scoring with PREDICT in Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabric-predict).

1. Load the better-performing model (**Version 2**) for batch scoring, and generate the prediction results:

    ```python
    from synapse.ml.predict import MLFlowTransformer
    
    spark.conf.set("spark.synapse.ml.predict.enabled", "true")
    
    model = MLFlowTransformer(
        inputCols=feature_cols,
        outputCol="prediction",
        modelName=f"{EXPERIMENT_NAME}-lightgbm",
        modelVersion=2,
    )
    
    test_spark = spark.createDataFrame(data=test, schema=test.columns.to_list())
    
    batch_predictions = model.transform(test_spark)
    ```

1. Save predictions to the lakehouse:

    ```python
    # Save the predictions to the lakehouse
    batch_predictions.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save(f"{DATA_FOLDER}/predictions/batch_predictions")
    ```
