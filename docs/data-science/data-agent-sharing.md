# Fabric data agent sharing and permission management (preview)

## Publishing and versioning

Creation of a data agent in Microsoft Fabric is an iterative process. It involves refinement of various configurations, for example

- selection of relevant tables
- Fabric data agent instruction definition
- production of example queries for each data source

As you make adjustments to enhance the performance of the Fabric data agent, you can eventually publish that Fabric data agent. Once published, a read-only version is generated, which you can share with others.

When you try to publish the Fabric data agent, you can include a description that explains what the Fabric data agent does. The description is available to consumers of the Fabric data agent, to help them understand its purpose and functionality. Other automated systems and orchestrators can also use the description, to invoke the Fabric data agent outside of Microsoft Fabric.

> [!NOTE]
> You can ask the Fabric data agent to describe what it does. You can then refine and summarize the response to use as its description when publishing.

After you publish your Fabric data agent, you can continue to refine its current draft version to enhance its performance, without affecting the published version that other people use. This way, you can iterate with confidence, knowing that your changes remain isolated from the published version. You can seamlessly switch between the published and draft versions, testing the same set of queries on both to compare their performance. This helps you assess the effects of your changes, and you can gain valuable insights into how they improve the effectiveness of your Fabric data agent. The following screenshot shows how to switch between published and developed Fabric data agent versions:

To update the Fabric data agent description without making any other changes, navigate to **Settings**, select **Publishing**, and then update the description, as show in this screenshot:

## Permission models for sharing the Fabric data agent

The **Fabric data agent sharing** feature allows you to share your Fabric data agents with others, with a range of permission models, as shown in this screenshot:

You have complete control over access to your Fabric data agent, and complete control of its use. Additionally, when you share the Fabric data agent, you must also share access to the underlying data it uses. The Fabric data agent honors all user permissions to the data, including Row-Level Security (RLS) and Column-Level Security (CLS).

- **No permission selected**: If you don't select any other permission, users can only query the **published** version of the Fabric data agent. They have no access to edit or even view any configurations or details. This maintains the integrity of your Fabric data agent set-up.
- **View details**: Users can view the details and configurations of both the published and draft versions of the Fabric data agent, but they can't make any changes to it. However, they can still query the Fabric data agent, and build informative insights without risk of unintended modifications.
- **Edit and view details**: Users have full access to view and edit all the details and configurations of both the published and draft versions of the Fabric data agent. They can also query the Fabric data agent, which makes it ideal for collaborative work.

The following screenshot shows the actual permissions that you can select:

If you share a Fabric data agent before you publish it, users with default permissions (without any other permissions) can't query it. It works this way because the default permission allows users to query only the published versionâ€”if a published version doesn't yet exist, users can't query the Fabric data agent. Users with other permissions (**View details**, or **Edit and view details**) can only access the draft version. The following screenshot shows the option to share a Fabric data agent without publishing it:
