# Fabric Data Agent Python SDK

The Fabric Data Agent Python SDK library facilitates programmatic access to Fabric Data Agent artifacts. The SDK is designed for code-first users, and it simplifies the creation, management, and utilization of Fabric data agents within Microsoft Fabric notebooks. It provides a set of straightforward APIs to integrate and manage data sources, automate workflow operations, and interact with the Fabric data agent, based on the OpenAI Assistants API within Microsoft Fabric notebook.

## Prerequisites
- Python Version: A compatible version of Python (typically Python >= 3.10).
- Dependencies: The SDK might require other packages. Pip automatically installs these packages.
- Environment: This SDK is designed to work exclusively within Microsoft Fabric notebooks. It isn't supported for local execution.

## Features

- **Programmatic Management:** Create, update, and delete Data Agent artifacts seamlessly.
- **Data Source Integration:** Easily connect to and integrate multiple data sources, for enhanced data analysis and insight generation.
- **OpenAI Assistants API Support:** Use the OpenAI Assistants API for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
- **Workflow Automation:** Automate routine tasks to reduce manual efforts and improve operational efficiency.
- **Resource Optimization:** Optimize configuration and management of Data Agent resources to better align with specific customer needs.

## Installation

Use pip to install the Fabric data agent Python SDK:

```
pip install fabric-data-agent-sdk
```
