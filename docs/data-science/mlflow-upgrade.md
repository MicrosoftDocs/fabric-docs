# Upgrade your machine learning tracking system

Microsoft Fabric integrates MLflow, an open-source machine learning tracking platform that automatically tracks your experiments and model runs. As a data scientist, you can log metrics, hyperparameters, and model versions throughout your development process, creating a complete audit trail from experimentation to production. This integration makes it easy for teams to compare results, reproduce models, and collaborate effectively across the entire ML lifecycle.

## Upgrade to the latest machine learning tracking experience

Starting November 2025, we're introducing an enhanced machine learning experiment tracking experience for your workspace. This upgrade is optional and available on-demand. If you choose not to upgrade manually, we'll automatically update your system by the end of Q1 2026.

## How to upgrade your workspace

If your workspace is eligible for an upgrade, you can start the process in two simple ways:

### Option 1: Through ML experiments or models
1. Open any ML experiment or ML model in your workspace.
2. Look for the upgrade banner at the top of the page.
3. Select **Start upgrade** to begin the process.

### Option 2: Through workspace settings
1. Navigate to your workspace settings.
2. Go to **Data Engineering/Science** > **ML tracking**.
3. Look for the upgrade notification.
4. Select the **Start upgrade** button.

## What to expect

The upgrade process typically takes less than 5 minutes, though this duration might vary depending on the number and size of your ML artifacts.

If you encounter any issues or have questions during the upgrade process, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. We're here to help ensure your transition to the new tracking experience goes smoothly.
