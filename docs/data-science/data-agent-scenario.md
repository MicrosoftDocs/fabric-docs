# Fabric data agent example with the AdventureWorks dataset (preview)

This article describes how to set up a data agent in Microsoft Fabric, using a lakehouse as a data source. To illustrate the process, we first create a lakehouse, and then add data to it. Then, we create a Fabric data agent and configure the lakehouse as its data source. If you already have a Power BI semantic model (with the necessary read/write permissions), a warehouse, or a KQL database, you can follow the same steps after you create the Fabric data agent to add your data sources. While the steps shown here focus on the lakehouse, the process is similar for other data sourcesâ€”you just need to make adjustments based on your specific selection.

## Create a lakehouse with AdventureWorksLH

First, create a lakehouse and populate it with the necessary data.

If you already have an instance of AdventureWorksLH in a lakehouse (or a warehouse), you can skip this step. If not, you can use the following instructions from a Fabric notebook to populate the lakehouse with the data.

1. Create a new notebook in the workspace where you want to create your Fabric data agent.

1. On the left side of the **Explorer** pane, select **+ Data sources**. This option allows you to add an existing lakehouse or creates a new lakehouse. For sake of clarity, create a new lakehouse and assign a name to it.

1. In the top cell, add the following code snippet:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from tqdm.auto import tqdm
    base = "https://synapseaisolutionsa.z13.web.core.windows.net/data/AdventureWorks"
    
    # load list of tables
    df_tables = pd.read_csv(f"{base}/adventureworks.csv", names=["table"])
    
    for table in (pbar := tqdm(df_tables['table'].values)):
        pbar.set_description(f"Uploading {table} to lakehouse")
    
        # download
        df = pd.read_parquet(f"{base}/{table}.parquet")
    
        # save as lakehouse table
        spark.createDataFrame(df).write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable(table)
    ```

1. Select **Run all**.

After a few minutes, the lakehouse populates with the necessary data.

## Create a Fabric data agent

To create a new Fabric data agent, navigate to your workspace and select the **+ New Item** button, as shown in this screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/create-data-agent.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to create Fabric data agents." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/create-data-agent.png":::

In the All items tab, search for **Fabric data agent** to locate the appropriate option. Once selected, a prompt asks you to provide a name for your Fabric data agent, as shown in this screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/name-data-agent.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to provide name for the Fabric data agent." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/name-data-agent.png":::

After you enter the name, proceed with the following steps to align the Fabric data agent with your specific requirements.

## Select the data

Select the lakehouse you created in the previous step, and then select **Add**, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/select-and-add-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the add a lakehouse step." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/select-and-add-lakehouse.png":::

Once the lakehouse is added as a data source, the **Explorer** pane on the left side of the Fabric data agent page shows the lakehouse name. Select the lakehouse to view all available tables. Use the checkboxes to select the tables you want to make available to the AI. For this scenario, select these tables:

- `dimcustomer`
- `dimdate`
- `dimgeography`
- `dimproduct`
- `dimproductcategory`
- `dimpromotion`
- `dimreseller`
- `dimsalesterritory`
- `factinternetsales`
- `factresellersales`

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/get-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where you can select tables for AI." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/get-started.png":::

## Provide instructions

To add Fabric data agent instructions, select the **Data agent instructions** button to open the Fabric data agent instructions pane on the right. You can add the following instructions.

The `AdventureWorksLH` data source contains information from three tables:

- `dimcustomer`, for detailed customer demographics and contact information
- `dimdate`, for date-related data - for example, calendar and fiscal information
- `dimgeography`, for geographical details including city names and country region codes.

Use this data source for queries and analyses that involve customer details, time-based events, and geographical locations.

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/add-ai-instructions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where you can provide the instructions to the AI." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/add-ai-instructions.png":::

## Provide examples

To add example queries, select the **Example queries** button to open the example queries pane on the right. This pane provides options to add or edit example queries for all supported data sources. For each data source, you can select **Add or Edit Example Queries** to input the relevant examples, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/add-example-queries-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where you can add the examples you provide to the AI." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/add-example-queries-lakehouse.png":::

Here, you should add Example queries for the lakehouse data source that you created.

`Question: Calculate the average percentage increase in sales amount for repeat purchases for every zipcode. Repeat purchase is a purchase subsequent to the first purchase (the average should always be computed relative to the first purchase)`

```SQL
SELECT AVG((s.SalesAmount - first_purchase.SalesAmount) / first_purchase.SalesAmount * 100) AS AvgPercentageIncrease
FROM factinternetsales s
INNER JOIN dimcustomer c ON s.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey
INNER JOIN dimgeography g ON c.GeographyKey = g.GeographyKey
INNER JOIN (
	SELECT *
	FROM (
		SELECT
			CustomerKey,
			SalesAmount,
            OrderDate,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerKey ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RowNumber
		FROM factinternetsales
	) AS t
	WHERE RowNumber = 1
) first_purchase ON s.CustomerKey = first_purchase.CustomerKey
WHERE s.OrderDate > first_purchase.OrderDate
GROUP BY g.PostalCode;
```

`Question: Show the monthly total and year-to-date total sales. Order by year and month.`

```SQL
SELECT
    Year,
	Month,
	MonthlySales,
	SUM(MonthlySales) OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Year, Month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS CumulativeTotal
FROM (
	SELECT
	   YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,
	   MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,
	   SUM(SalesAmount) AS MonthlySales
	FROM factinternetsales
	GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)
) AS t
```

> [!NOTE]
> Adding sample query/question pairs isn't currently supported for Power BI semantic model data sources.

## Test and revise the Fabric data agent

Now that you configured the Fabric data agent, added Fabric data agent instructions, and provided example queries for the lakehouse, you can interact with it by asking questions and receiving answers. As you continue testing, you can add more examples, and refine the instructions, to further improve the performance of the Fabric data agent. Collaborate with your colleagues to gather feedback, and based on their input, ensure the provided example queries and instructions align with the types of questions they want to ask.

## Publish the Fabric data agent

After you validate the performance of the Fabric data agent, you might decide to publish it so you can then share it with your colleagues who want to do Q&A over data. In this case, select **Publish**, as shown in this screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/ai-select-publish.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selection of the Publish option." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/ai-select-publish.png":::

The **Publish data agent** box opens, as shown in this screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/publish-data-agent.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the publish data agent feature." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/publish-data-agent.png":::

In this box, select **Publish** to publish the Fabric data agent. The published URL for the Fabric data agent appears, as shown in this screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/fabric-notebook-data-agent-published-url-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the published URL." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/fabric-notebook-data-agent-published-url-value.png":::

## Use the Fabric data agent in Copilot in Power BI

You can use the Copilot in Power BI to interact with the Fabric data agent after you publish it. With Copilot in Power BI, you can directly consume the data agent and other items (for example, reports, or semantic models) without needing to switch between them.

Select the **Copilot** button on the left navigation pane, to open the Copilot in Power BI. Next, select **Add items for better results** in the text box at the bottom, to add the data agent. Select **Data agents** in the window that opens. You can only see the data agents that you have permission to access. Choose the data agent you want and select **Confirm**. This example shows how to work with a single data agent, but you can add more items - for example, other data agents, reports, or semantic models. The following screenshot illustrates the steps with a single data agent:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/copilot-in-powerbi-add-agent.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copilot button and button to add items such as Data Agents." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/copilot-in-powerbi-add-agent.png":::

Now that you added the data agent to the Copilot in Power BI, you can ask any questions related to your Fabric data agent, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/copilot-in-powerbi-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copilot answering a question." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/copilot-in-powerbi-chat.png":::

## Use the Fabric data agent programmatically

You can use the Fabric data agent programmatically within a Fabric notebook. To determine whether or not the Fabric data agent has a published URL value, select **Settings**, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/initial-data-agent-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selection of Fabric data agent settings." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/initial-data-agent-settings.png":::

Before you publish the Fabric data agent, it doesn't have a published URL value, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-agent-scenario/fabric-notebook-data-agent-no-published-url-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that a Fabric data agent doesn't have a published URL value before publication." lightbox="./media/data-agent-scenario/fabric-notebook-data-agent-no-published-url-value.png":::

If you haven't published the Fabric data agent before, you can publish it following the instructions in the previous steps. You can then copy the published URL and use it in the Fabric notebook. This way, you can query the Fabric data agent by making calls to the Fabric data agent API in a Fabric notebook. Paste the copied URL in this code snippet. Then, replace the question with any query relevant to your Fabric data agent. This example uses `\<generic published URL value\>` as the URL.
