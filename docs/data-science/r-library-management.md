# R library management

Libraries provide reusable code that you might want to include in your programs or projects for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] Spark.


[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] supports an R runtime with many popular open-source R packages, including TidyVerse, preinstalled. When a Spark instance starts, these libraries are included automatically and available to be used immediately in notebooks or Spark job definitions. 

You might need to update your R libraries for various reasons. For example, one of your core dependencies released a new version, or your team has built a custom package that you need available in your Spark clusters.

There are two types of libraries you may want to include based on your scenario:

- **Feed libraries** refer to the ones residing in public sources or repositories, such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or GitHub.

- **Custom libraries** are the code built by you or your organization, _.tar.gz_ can be managed through Library Management portals.

There are two levels of packages installed on [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]:

- **Environment**: Manage libraries through an [environment](../data-engineering/create-and-use-environment.md) to reuse the same set of libraries across multiple notebooks or jobs.

- **Session** : A session-level installation creates an environment for a specific notebook session. The change of session-level libraries isn't persisted between sessions. 

Summarizing the current available R library management behaviors: 

|Library Type |Environment installation |Session-level installation |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|R Feed (CRAN)|Not Supported| Supported|
|R Custom |Supported| Supported|

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites](./includes/prerequisites.md)]



## Session-level R libraries

When doing interactive data analysis or machine learning, you might try newer packages or you might need packages that are currently unavailable on your workspace. Instead of updating the workspace settings, you can use session-scoped packages to add, manage, and update session dependencies.

- When you install session-scoped libraries, only the current notebook has access to the specified libraries.
- These libraries don't impact other sessions or jobs using the same Spark pool.
- These libraries are installed on top of the base runtime and pool level libraries.
- Notebook libraries take the highest precedence.
- Session-scoped R libraries don't persist across sessions. These libraries are installed at the start of each session when the related installation commands are executed.
- Session-scoped R libraries are automatically installed across both the driver and worker nodes.

> [!NOTE]
> The commands of managing R libraries are disabled when running pipeline jobs. If you want to install a package within a pipeline, you must use the library management capabilities at the workspace level.

### Install R packages from CRAN

You can easily install an R library from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

```R
# install a package from CRAN
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "Lahman"))
```
You can also use CRAN snapshots as the repository to ensure to download the same package version each time.

```R
# install a package from CRAN snapsho
install.packages("highcharter", repos = "https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2021-07-16/")
```

### Install R packages using devtools

The `devtools` library simplifies package development to expedite common tasks. This library is installed within the default [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] runtime.

You can use `devtools` to specify a specific version of a library to install. These libraries are installed across all nodes within the cluster.

```R
# Install a specific version. 
install_version("caesar", version = "1.0.0")
```
Similarly, you can install a library directly from GitHub.

```R
# Install a GitHub library. 

install_github("jtilly/matchingR")
```

Currently, the following `devtools` functions are supported within [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]:


|Command|Description|
|---------------|----------------|
|install_github()	|Installs an R package from GitHub|
|install_gitlab()	|Installs an R package from GitLab|
|install_bitbucket()	|Installs an R package from BitBucket|
|install_url()	|Installs an R package from an arbitrary URL|
|install_git()	|Installs from an arbitrary git repository|
|install_local()	|Installs from a local file on disk|
|install_version()	|Installs from a specific version on CRAN|

### Install R custom libraries

To use a session-level custom library, you must first upload it to an attached Lakehouse.  

1. Open the notebook you want to use the custom library in.
1. On the left side, select **Add** to add an existing lakehouse or create a lakehouse.

    :::image type="content" source="media/r-library-management/add-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to add a lakehouse to your notebook.":::

1. Right click or select the "..." next to **Files** to upload your _.tar.gz_ file.

    :::image type="content" source="media/r-library-management/upload-files.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to upload your file to the lakehouse Files folder.":::


1. After uploading, go back to your notebook.  Use the following command to install the custom library to your session:

    ```R
    install.packages("filepath/filename.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
    ```

### View installed libraries

Query all the libraries installed within your session using the `library` command.

```R
# query all the libraries installed in current session
library()
```

Use the `packageVersion` function to check the version of the library:

```R
# check the package version
packageVersion("caesar")
```

### Remove an R package from a session

You can use the `detach` function to remove a library from the namespace. These libraries stay on disk until they're loaded again.

```R
# detach a library

detach("package: caesar")
```

To remove a session-scoped package from a notebook, use the `remove.packages()` command. This library change has no impact on other sessions on the same cluster. Users can't uninstall or remove built-in libraries of the default [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can't remove core packages like SparkR, SparklyR, or R.

```R
remove.packages("caesar")
```

### Session-scoped R libraries and SparkR

Notebook-scoped libraries are available on SparkR workers.

```R
install.packages("stringr")
library(SparkR)

str_length_function <- function(x) {
  library(stringr)
  str_length(x)
}

docs <- c("Wow, I really like the new light sabers!",
               "That book was excellent.",
               "R is a fantastic language.",
               "The service in this restaurant was miserable.",
               "This is neither positive or negative.")

spark.lapply(docs, str_length_function)
```

### Session-scoped R libraries and sparklyr

With `spark_apply()` in sparklyr, you can use any R packages inside Spark. By default, in `sparklyr::spark_apply()`, the packages argument sets to FALSE. This copies libraries in the current libPaths to the workers, allowing you to import and use them on workers. For example, you can run the following to generate a caesar-encrypted message with `sparklyr::spark_apply()`:

```R
install.packages("caesar", repos = "https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2021-07-16/")

spark_version <- sparkR.version()
config <- spark_config()
sc <- spark_connect(master = "yarn", version = spark_version, spark_home = "/opt/spark", config = config)

apply_cases <- function(x) {
  library(caesar)
  caesar("hello world")
}
sdf_len(sc, 5) %>%
  spark_apply(apply_cases, packages=FALSE)
```
