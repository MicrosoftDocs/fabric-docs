### In-product surveys

From time to time, Microsoft Fabric initiates in-product surveys to collect feedback from users. When you see a prompt, you can choose to give feedback or dismiss the prompt. If you dismiss the prompt, you won't see it again for some time.

### Community feedback

There are a few ways you can give feedback while engaging with the Microsoft Fabric community:

* [Ideas](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Ideas/ct-p/PBI_Comm_Ideas) - Submit and vote on ideas for Microsoft Fabric.

* [Issues](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Issues/idb-p/Issues) - Discuss issues and workarounds with the community.

* [Community Feedback](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Community-Feedback/bd-p/community-feedback) - Give feedback about Microsoft Fabric and vote for publicly submitted feedback. Top known feedback items remain available in the new portal.

## What kind of feedback is best?

Try to give detailed and actionable feedback. If you have issues, or suggestions for how we can improve, we’d like to hear it.

* **Descriptive title** - Descriptive and specific titles help us understand the issue being reported.

* **One issue** - Providing feedback for one issue ensures the correct logs and data are received with each submission and can be assigned for follow-up. If you want to give feedback for multiple issues, give feedback for each issue separately. Giving feedback for Separate issues helps us identify the volume of feedback we’re receiving for a particular issue.  If you have more than one issue, submit a new feedback request for each issue.

* **Give details** - Give details about your issue in the description box. Information about your device, operating system, and apps are automatically included in each reported feedback. Add any additional information you think is important. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue.

## How Microsoft uses feedback 

Microsoft uses feedback to improve Microsoft products. We get user feedback in the form of questions, problems, compliments, and suggestions. We make sure this feedback makes it back to the appropriate teams, who use feedback to identify, prioritize and make improvements to Microsoft products. Feedback is essential for our product teams to understand our user's experiences, and directly influences the priority of fixes and improvements.
