# Overview of Copilot in Fabric (preview)

With Copilot and other generative AI features in preview, Microsoft Fabric brings a new way to transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports.

Before your business starts using Copilot capabilities in Fabric, you may have questions about how it works, how it keeps your business data secure and adheres to privacy requirements, and how to use generative AI responsibly. Read on for answers to these and other questions.

## Copilot for Data Science and Data Engineering

Copilot for Data Engineering and Data Science is an AI-enhanced toolset tailored to support data professionals in their workflow. It provides intelligent code completion, automates routine tasks, and supplies industry-standard code templates to facilitate building robust data pipelines and crafting complex analytical models. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, Copilot offers contextual code suggestions that adapt to the specific task at hand, helping you code more effectively and with greater ease. From data preparation to insight generation, Microsoft Fabric Copilot acts as an interactive aide, lightening the load on engineers and scientists and expediting the journey from raw data to meaningful conclusions.

## Copilot for Data Factory

Copilot for Data Factory is an AI-enhanced toolset that supports both citizen and professional data wranglers in streamlining their workflow. It provides intelligent code generation to transform data with ease and generates code explanations to help you better understand complex tasks.

## Copilot for Power BI

Power BI has introduced generative AI that allows you to create reports automatically by selecting the topic for a report or by prompting Copilot for Power BI on a particular topic. You can use Copilot for Power BI to generate a summary for the report page that you just created, and generate synonyms for better Q&A capabilities. See the article [Overview of Copilot for Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction) for details of the features and how to use Copilot for Power BI.

## How do I use Copilot responsibly?

Microsoft is committed to ensuring that our AI systems are guided by our [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach/) and [Responsible AI Standard](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE5cmFl). These principles include empowering our customers to use these systems effectively and in line with their intended uses. Our approach to responsible AI is continually evolving to proactively address emerging issues. Copilot sends your customer data to generate summaries to Azure OAI, where it's stored for 30 days. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms) for details.

The article [Privacy, security, and responsible use for Copilot (preview)](copilot-privacy-security.md) offers guidance on responsible use.

Copilot features in Fabric are built to meet the Responsible AI Standard, which means that they're reviewed by multidisciplinary teams for potential harms, and then refined to include mitigations for those harms.  

Before you use Copilot, your admin needs to enable Copilot in Fabric. See the article [Enable Copilot in Fabric (preview)](copilot-fabric-enable.md) for details. Also, keep in mind the limitations of Copilot:

- Copilot responses can include inaccurate or low-quality content, so make sure to review outputs before using them in your work.
- Reviews of outputs should be done by people who are able to meaningfully evaluate the content's accuracy and appropriateness.
- Today, Copilot features work best in the English language. Other languages may not perform as well.
