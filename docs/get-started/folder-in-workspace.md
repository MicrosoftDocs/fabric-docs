# Folder in workspace

Folder is an organizational unit inside a workspace that enables users to efficiently organize and manage artifacts in the workspace.

## Permission model
Workspace admins, members, and contributors can create, modify, and delete folders in the workspace. Viewers can only view folder hierarchy and navigate in the workspace.

Currently folders inherit the permissions of the workspace they are in. 

| Capability                   | Admin   | Member   | Contributor | Viewer   |
|------------------------------|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Create folder                | &#9989; | &#9989;  | &#9989;     | &#10060; |
| Delete folder                | &#9989; | &#9989;  | &#9989;     | &#10060; |
| Rename folder                | &#9989; | &#9989;  | &#9989;     | &#10060; |
| Move folder and items        | &#9989; | &#9989;  | &#9989;     | &#10060; |
