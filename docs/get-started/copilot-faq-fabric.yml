    questions:
      - question: |
          I loaded my semantic model, but it doesn't meet all the criteria listed in the data evaluation. What should I do?  
        answer: |
          The criteria listed in [Update your data model to work well with Copilot for Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-evaluate-data) is important because it helps you get a better quality report. As long as you meet seven of the eight points, including Consistency, the quality of the reports generated should be good.  

          If your data doesn't meet that criteria, we recommend spending the time to bring it into compliance.  
      - question: |
          I was given a Copilot URL, but I can't see the Copilot button. Why is that?  
        answer: |
          First, check with your admin to see if they have enabled Copilot.

          Next, when you select a Copilot-enabled URL, you have to initially load the semantic model. When you've completed loading the semantic model, then you see the Copilot button. See the [Create a report with Copilot for the Power BI service](/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-create-report) article.

          If you load a semantic model and still can't see the Copilot button, file a bug here: Copilot Bug Template.
      - question: |
          I selected the Copilot button, and it's stuck on Analyzing your semantic model  
        answer: |
          Depending upon the size of the semantic model, Copilot might take a while to analyze it. If you've waited longer than 15 minutes and you haven't received any errors, chances are that there is an internal server error. 

          Try restarting Copilot by closing the pane and selecting the Copilot button again.
      - question: |
          I loaded the semantic model and Copilot generated a summary, but I don't think that it's accurate
        answer: |
          This inaccuracy could be because your semantic model has missing values. Because AI is generating the summary, it can try to fill the holes and fabricate data. If you can remove the rows with missing values, this situation could be avoided.
      - question: |
          I generated the report visuals, but the quality of the visuals concern me. I wouldn't choose them myself  
        answer: |
          We're continuously looking to improve the quality of the copilot generated visuals. For now, we recommend that you make the change by using the Power BI visualization tool.
      - question: |
          The accuracy of the narrative visual concerns me. 
        answer: |
          We're continuously working to improve the accuracy of the narrative visual results. The Power BI team already has plans to improve the accuracy over the coming months. As a public preview, there might be mistakes. Know that we're working toward making the tool as accurate as possible. In the meantime, we recommend using the custom prompts as an additional tool to try to tweak the summary to meet your needs.
      - question: |
          I want to disable Copilot immediately as I'm concerned with the data storage as you mention previously
        answer: |
          Contact your help desk to get support from your IT admin.
      - question: |
          I want to suggest new features. How can I do that?  
        answer: |
          First, thank you for the feedback. It's great that you found it useful. As part of the feedback sessions, we send you a form and you can add your suggestions there.

    questions:
      - question: |
          I'm a Fabric user. I opened the semantic model in Data Factory. Why can't I see Copilot?  
        answer: |
          We have only enabled Copilot for Power BI. In the future, we'll enable it for other areas of Fabric as well. We don't have a timeline yet for those areas.
