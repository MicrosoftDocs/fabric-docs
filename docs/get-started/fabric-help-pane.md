# Self-help with the Fabric contextual Help pane

This article explains how to use the Fabric Help pane. The Help pane is feature-aware and displays articles about the actions and features available on the current Fabric screen. The Help pane is also a search engine that quickly finds answers to questions in the Fabric documentation and Fabric community forums.

## The Help pane is feature-aware

The feature-aware state is the default view of the Help pane when you open it without entering any search terms. The Help pane shows a list of recommended topics, resources that are relevant to your current context and location in Fabric, and a list of links for other resources. It has three sections:

- **Feature-aware documents**: This section groups the documents by the features that are available on the current screen. Select a feature in the Fabric screen and the Help pane updates with documents related to that feature.  Select a document to open it in a separate browser tab.  
- **Forum topics**: This section shows topics from the community forums that are related to the features on the current screen. Select a topic to open it in a separate browser tab.
- **Other resources**: This section has links for feedback and Support.

## The Help pane is a search engine

The Help pane is also a search engine. Enter a keyword to find relevant information and resources from Microsoft documentation and community forum topics. Use the dropdown to filter the results.
