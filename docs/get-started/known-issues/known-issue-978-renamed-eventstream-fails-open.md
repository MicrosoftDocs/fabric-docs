# Known issue - Eventstream fails to open after renaming

After renaming an eventstream item, you can try to open it. You receive a pop-up notification indicating that the eventstream failed to open. Then, if you try to open another eventstream in the same workspace, the opening also fails, displaying the same error message. You can refresh the browser to allow the other eventstreams to open successfully, but the renamed eventstream remains inaccessible.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Real-Time Intelligence

## Symptoms

You receive an error when you try to open a renamed eventstream. You also receive an error when trying to open other eventstreams in the same workspace where a renamed eventstream resides.

## Solutions and workarounds

To work around the issue, rename the eventstream back to its original name. Refresh the page, and then you can open eventstreams in that workspace.
