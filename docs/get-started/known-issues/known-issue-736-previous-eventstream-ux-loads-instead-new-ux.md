# Known issue - Previous Eventstream UX loads instead of new UX

The previous GA Eventstream UX might load immediately after creating a new eventstream with the enhanced capability preview toggle enabled.

**Product Experience:** Real-Time Intelligence

## Symptoms

When you open an eventstream, you see the previous GA UX instead of the new preview version UX.
