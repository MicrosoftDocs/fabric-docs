# Known issue - Previous Eventstream UX loads instead of new UX

The previous GA Eventstream UX might load immediately after creating a new eventstream with the enhanced capability preview toggle enabled. To access the new Eventstream UX homepage with the enhanced capabilities, refresh the page two to three times before starting an eventstream configuration. This issue occurs intermittently.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Real-Time Intelligence

## Symptoms

When you open an eventstream, you see the previous GA UX instead of the new preview version UX.

## Solutions and workarounds

Refresh the page two to three times after the newly created eventstream is open.
