# Known issue - ParquetSharpNative error in dataflow refresh using a gateway

After you upgrade to the December 2023 (or newer) version of the on-premises data gateway, Dataflow Gen2 refreshes using that gateway might start failing with the error "Unable to load DLL 'ParquetSharpNative'."

**Status:** Fixed: March 20, 2024

**Product Experience:** Data Factory

## Symptoms

You have a Dataflow Gen2 dataflow that uses the December 2023 (or newer) version of the on-premises data gateway. When you try to refresh the dataflow, the refresh fails with the following error message: "Couldnâ€™t refresh the entity because of an issue with the mashup document. MashupException.Error: Unable to load DLL 'ParquetSharpNative': A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007045A)."

## Solutions and workarounds

The issue is fixed. Upgrade to the March 2024 version of the on-premises data gateway to stop receiving the error. If you run the on-premises data gateway on a Hyper-V virtual machine with processor compatibility mode turned on, try disabling processor compatibility mode.
