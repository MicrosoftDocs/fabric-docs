# Known issue - Creating or updating Fabric items is blocked

You can't create or update a Fabric or Power BI item because your organization's compute capacity has exceeded its limits. You don't receive an error message when the creation or update is blocked. However, when the compute capacity exceeded its limits, a notification was sent to your company's Fabric admin.

**Status:** Fixed: June 6, 2024

**Product Experience:** Administration & Management

## Symptoms

You can't load a page, create an item, or update anything in Fabric.

## Solutions and workarounds

In the future, we'll improve the notifications for the known issue to improve your experience.  In the meantime, wait a while and retry your request to see if capacity is available.  For further information on capacity usage, reach out to your capacity admin.
