# Known issue - Type mismatch when writing decimals and dates to lakehouse using a dataflow

You can create a Dataflow Gen2 dataflow that writes data to a lakehouse as an output destination. If the source data has a **Decimal** or **Date** data type, you might see a different data type appear in the lakehouse after running the dataflow. For example, when the data type is **Date**, the resulting data type is sometimes converted to **Datetime**, and when the data type is **Decimal**, the resulting data type is sometime converted to **Float**.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Data Factory

## Symptoms

You see an unexpected data type in the lakehouse after running a dataflow.
