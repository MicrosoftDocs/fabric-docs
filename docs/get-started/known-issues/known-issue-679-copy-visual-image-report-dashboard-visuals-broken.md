# Known issue - Copy visual as image for report and dashboard visuals is broken

The **Copy visual as image** functionality is broken for both report and dashboard visuals. As a result, you can't copy visuals as images or images with captions in Power BI.

**Status:** Fixed: May 1, 2024

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

You can try to copy a visual in a report or dashboard by selecting the **Copy visual as image** option by either right-clicking or selecting the ellipses on an image. When you select the option, you receive an error message that the image couldn't be copied since the server is busy. The image isn't successfully copied.

## Solutions and workarounds

Rather than use the **Copy visual as image** option, you can use your operating system screenshot tools to capture screenshots of report and dashboard visuals.
