# Known issue - Report Copilot button shows even though Copilot admin setting is off

Even if the tenant admin setting **Users can use a preview of Copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI** is turned off, the Copilot button still appears on reports. You can select the button to open the pane, but the pane shows an error and Copilot can't be used.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

Even when the tenant switch is off, the Copilot button still shows in the following situations:

 - In apps, the button shows on reports shared with viewers without workspace access
 - On reports, the button shows on reports that are in a workspace whose capacity doesn't support Copilot

## Solutions and workarounds

To work around the issue, ignore the Copilot button. This article will be updated when the fix is released.
