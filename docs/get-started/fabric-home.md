# Navigate to your items from [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] Home

This article gives a high level view of navigating to your items and actions from [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] Home. Each product experience has its own Home, and there are similarities that they all share. Those similarities are described in this article. For detailed information about **Home** for a particular product experience, such as Data Factory Home, visit the relevant page for that product experience. 

## Overview of Home 

On Home, you see items that you create and that you have permission to use. These items are from all the workspaces that you access. That means that the items available on everyone's Home are different. At first, you might not have much content, but that changes as you start to create and share [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] items.

> [!NOTE]
> Home is not workspace-specific. For example, the **Recent** area on Home might include items from many different workspaces.

In [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], the term *item* refers to: apps, lakehouses, warehouses, reports, and more. Your items are accessible and viewable in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], and often the best place to start working in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] is from **Home**. However, once you've created at least one new workspace, been granted access to a workspace, or you've added an item to **My workspace**, you might find it more convenient to navigate directly to a workspace. One way to navigate to a workspace is by using the nav pane and workspace selector.

To open **Home**, select it from the top of your left navigation pane. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Home icon.":::

## Most important content at your fingertips

The items that you can access appear on Home. If your Home canvas gets crowded, use [global search](fabric-search.md) to find what you need, quickly. The layout and content on Home is different for every user and every product experience, but there are numerous similarities as well. These similarities are listed here and discussed in more detail later in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> **Power BI Home** is different from the other product experiences. To learn more, visit [Power BI Home](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-home).

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-numbered.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the left navigation menu with Knowledge center selected":::

1. The left navigation pane (nav pane) for your product experience links you to different views of your items and to creator resources. 
1. The selector for switching product experiences.
1. The top menu bar for orienting yourself in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], finding items, help, and sending Microsoft feedback. The [**Account manager**](#find-your-account-and-license-information) control is a critical icon for looking up your account information and managing your Fabric trial. 
1. Options for creating new items.  
1. Links to recommended content. This content helps you get started using the product experience and links to items and workspaces that you visit often.
1. Your items organized by recent, favorites, and items shared with you by your colleagues. The items that appear here are the same across product experiences, except for the Power BI experience.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the content that you can access appears on your Home. For example, if you don't have permissions to a report, that report doesn't appear on Home. The exception to this is if your subscription or license changes to one with less access, then you will receive a prompt asking you to start a trial or upgrade your license. 

## Locate items from Home

[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] offers many ways of locating and viewing your content. All approaches access the same pool of content in different ways. Searching is sometimes the easiest and quickest way to find something. While other times, using the nav pane to open a workspace or selecting a card on the Home canvas is your best option.

### Use the navigation pane

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-nav-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the nav pane for Data factory.":::        

Along the left side is a narrow vertical bar, referred to as the ***nav pane***. This example uses the Data factory nav pane. Notice that **My workspace** is the active workspace. The options in your nav pane depend on the product experience you've selected. The nav pane organizes actions you can take with your items in ways that help you get to where you want to be quickly. Occasionally, using the nav pane is the quickest way to get to your items. 

In the bottom section of the nav pane is where you find and open your workspaces. Use the [workspace selector](#find-and-open-workspaces) to view a list of your workspaces and select one to open. Below the workspace selector is the name of the currently open workspace.  
    - By default, you see the **Workspaces** selector and **My workspace**.  
    - When you open a workspace, its name replaces **My workspace**.  
    - Whenever you create a new item, it's added to the open workspace.  

The nav pane is there when you open Home and remains there as you open other areas of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]. Every [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] product experience nav pane includes **Home**, **Browse**, **OneLake data hub**, **Create**, and  **Workspaces**.

### Find and open workspaces

*Workspaces* are places to collaborate with colleagues to create collections of items such as lakehouses, warehouses, and reports. 

There are different ways to find and open your workspaces. If you know the name or owner, you can search. Or you can select the **Workspaces** icon in the nav pane and choose which workspace to open. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-workspaces.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing list of workspaces with red outlines around the Search fields and Workspaces icon.":::

The workspace opens on your canvas, and the name of the workspace is listed on your nav pane. When you open a workspace, you can view its content. It includes items such as notebooks, pipelines, reports, and lakehouses. 

For more information, see [Workspaces](workspaces.md).

### Find and open other product experiences

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the product experience selector expanded.":::

In the bottom left corner is your experience selector. Click the icon to see all of the available [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] product experiences. Select an experience to open it and make it active.

### Find your content using search, sort, and filter

To learn about the many ways to search from [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], see [Searching and sorting](fabric-search.md). Global searching is available by item, name, keyword, workspace, and more.

### Find answers in the context sensitive Help pane

Select the Help icon (**?**) to open and use the contextual Help pane and to search for answers to questions.

[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] provides context sensitive help in the right rail of your browser. In this example, we've selected **Browse** from the nav pane and the Help pane automatically updates to show us articles about the features of the **Browse** screen. For example, we're shown articles on *View recent content* and *See content that others have shared with you*. If there are community posts related to the current view, they're displayed under **Forum topics**. 

Leave the Help pane open as you work, and use the suggested topics to learn how to use [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] features and terminology. Or, select the **X** to close the Help pane and save screen space. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-help-contextual.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Help pane with Recent selected in Data factory.":::

The Help pane is also a great place to search for answers to your questions. Type your question or keywords in the **Search** field. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-help-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Help pane before beginning a search.":::

To return to the default Help pane, select the left arrow. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-arrow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the left arrow icon.":::

For more information about searching, see [Searching and sorting](fabric-search.md).

For more information about the Help pane, see [Get in-product help](fabric-help-pane.md).

### Find help and support

If the self-help answers don't resolve your issue, scroll to the bottom of the Help pane for more resources.  Use the links to ask the community for help or to connect with [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] Support. For more information about contacting Support, see [Support options](/power-bi/support/service-support-options).

### Find your account and license information

Information about your account and license is available from the Account manager. Select the tiny photo from the upper right corner of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] to open your Account manager. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-home-me.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Account manager expanded.":::

For more information about licenses and trials, see [Licenses](../enterprise/licenses.md).


### Find notifications, settings, and feedback

In the upper right corner of Home are several helpful icons. Take time to explore your **Notifications center**, **Settings**, and **Feedback** options. The **?** icon displays your [Help and search options](#find-help-and-support) and the [**Account manager** icon](#find-your-account-and-license-information) displays information about your account and license. Both of these features are described in detail earlier in this article.

### Find what you need on your Home canvas

The final section of Home is the center area, called the **canvas**. The content of your canvas updates as you select different items. By default, the Home canvas displays options for creating new items, recommended items, recents, favorites, and content that has been shared with you. If you've selected the **Show less** view, the **New** section of the canvas is collapsed. 

:::image type="content" source="media/fabric-home/fabric-show-less.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

When you create a new item, it's saved in your **My workspace** unless you've selected a workspace from **Workspaces**. To learn more about creating items in workspaces, see [create workspaces](create-workspaces.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI **Home** is different from the other product experiences. To learn more, visit [Power BI Home](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-home).

The **Recommended** area might include getting started content as well as items and workspaces that you use frequently.
