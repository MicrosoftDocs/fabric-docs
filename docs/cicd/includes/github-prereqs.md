To integrate Git with your Microsoft Fabric workspace, you need to set up the following prerequisites for both Fabric and Git.

### Fabric prerequisites

To access the Git integration feature, you need a [Fabric capacity](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity). A Fabric capacity is required to use all supported Fabric items. If you don't have one yet, [sign up for a free trial](/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial). Customers that already have a [Power BI Premium capacity](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-what-is), can use that capacity, but keep in mind that [certain Power BI SKUs only support Power BI items](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity).

In addition, the following [tenant switches](/fabric/admin/about-tenant-settings) must be enabled from the Admin portal:

- [Users can create Fabric items](/fabric/admin/fabric-switch)
- [Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#users-can-synchronize-workspace-items-with-their-git-repositories-preview)
- [Create workspaces](/fabric/admin/portal-workspace#create-workspaces-new-workspace-experience) (only if you want to branch out to a new workspace.)
- [Users can synchronize workspace items with GitHub repositories](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#users-can-synchronize-workspace-items-with-github-repositories-preview): For GitHub users only

These switches can be enabled by the tenant admin, capacity admin, or workspace admin, depending on your [organization's settings](/fabric/admin/delegate-settings).

### Git prerequisites

Git integration is currently supported for Azure DevOps and GitHub. To use Git integration with your Fabric workspace, you need the following in either Azure DevOps or GitHub:

### [Azure DevOps](#tab/azure-devops)

- An Active **Azure DevOps account** registered to the same user and tenant that is using the Fabric workspace (cross-tenant support is currently in preview). <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/" target="_blank">Create a free account</a>.
- Access to an existing repository.

### [GitHub](#tab/github)

- An active GitHub account. <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Create a GitHub account</a>.
