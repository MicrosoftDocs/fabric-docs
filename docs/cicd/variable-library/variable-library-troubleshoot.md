# Troubleshoot variable libraries 

This article provides solutions for common errors and problems that you might encounter when you work with Microsoft Fabric variable libraries.

## Failure to manage a variable library

### I can't find the icon for creating a variable library

**Description of the problem**: I want to create a variable library, but I can't find the **Create** icon.

**Cause**: The **Create** icon is available only if the **Users can create variable libraries** [tenant switch](../../admin/service-admin-portal-microsoft-fabric-tenant-settings.md) is enabled in the admin portal.

**Solution**: If you're an admin, go to the admin portal and enable the **Users can create variable libraries** tenant switch. If you're not an admin, contact your admin. Wait awhile, refresh the browser, clean the cache, and check again. Note that the change can take up to an hour to take effect.

### I can't create a variable library item

**Description of the problem**: I tried to create a variable library, but it failed.

**Cause**: The name of the variable library isn't valid.

**Solution**: Rename the variable library according to [naming conventions](./variable-types.md#variable-library-name).

### I can't save my variable library

**Description of the problem**: I tried to save my variable library, but it failed.

**Cause**: Reasons for this failure might include:

- The name of the variable or the value set isn't valid.
- The value isn't the correct type.
- The value is empty.
- The variable library size is greater than 1 MB.

**Solution**: Depending on the cause, you can try the following solutions:

- Review the errors on the validation pane and fix them so that no required value is missing or mismatched with the variable type.
- Ensure that all variables and value sets are named according to the [naming conventions](./variable-types.md#variable-library-name).
- Reduce the size of the variable library item to less than 1 MB by removing unused variables or by splitting the variable list into several variable libraries.

## Deployment pipeline failure

### I can't deploy my variable library in my deployment pipeline

**Description of the problem**: I tried to deploy the variable library, but I got a message that says "Can't start the deployment."

:::image type="content" source="./media/variable-library-troubleshoot/cant-start-deployment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the error message that says the deployment can't be started.":::

**Cause**: The active value set in the target stage is missing in the deployed variable library. A possible reason is that you removed or renamed the active value set in the source or target stage.

**Solution**: Change the active value set in the target stage, or rename the current value set to one that exists in the source.

## Variable reference failure

### I can't reference an added variable

**Description of the problem**: I can't find the variable that I want to refer to in the pipeline.

**Cause**: Reasons why a variable might not appear in the pipeline include:

- The variable wasn't saved.
- The variable was deleted or renamed.
- The variable was moved to another variable library.

**Solution**: Go back to the variable library and check the names of the existing variables. If the variable that you want exists but wasn't saved, save it. If it doesn't exist, create it.

After you find and fix the problem, remove the current reference and replace it with the correct name in the pipeline.

### Active value set not changed

**Description of the problem**: I changed the active value set in the variable library, but I still get the value from the previous active value set.

**Cause**: You might have forgotten to save your changes in the variable library.
  
**Solution**: Go back to the variable library, ensure that the correct value set is active, and save.
