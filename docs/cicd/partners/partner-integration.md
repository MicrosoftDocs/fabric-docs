# Microsoft Fabric Integration Pathways for ISVs

[Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric/blog/) offers three distinct pathways for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to seamlessly integrate with Fabric. For an ISV starting on this journey, we want to walk through various resources we have available under each of these pathways.

:::image type="content" source="media/partner-integration/integrate-fabric.png" alt-text="Figure showing the three pathways to integrate with Fabric: Interop, Develop Apps, and Build a Fabric workload.":::

## Interop with Fabric OneLake

The primary focus with Interop model is on enabling ISVs to integrate their solutions with the [OneLake Foundation](../../fundamentals/microsoft-fabric-overview.md). To Interop with Microsoft Fabric, we provide integration using a multitude of connectors in Data Factory and in Real-Time Intelligence. We also provide REST APIs for OneLake, shortcuts in OneLake, data sharing across Fabric tenants, and database mirroring.

:::image type="content" source="media/partner-integration/onelake-interop.png" alt-text="Figure showing different ways to interop with OneLake: APIs, Data Factory, Real-time intelligence, Multicloud shortcuts, data sharing, and database mirroring.":::

The following sections describe some of the ways you can get started with this model.

### OneLake APIs

- OneLake supports existing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 APIs and SDKs for direct interaction, allowing developers to read, write, and manage their data in OneLake. Learn more about [ADLS Gen2 REST APIs](/rest/api/storageservices) and [how to connect to OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-access-api.md).
- Since not all functionality in ADLS Gen2 maps directly to OneLake, OneLake also enforces a set folder structure to support Fabric workspaces and items. For a full list of different behaviors between OneLake and ADLS Gen2 when calling these APIs, see [OneLake API parity](../../onelake/onelake-api-parity.md).
- If you're using Databricks and want to connect to Microsoft Fabric, Databricks works with ADLS Gen2 APIs. [Integrate OneLake with Azure Databricks](../../onelake/onelake-azure-databricks.md).
- To take full advantage of what the Delta Lake storage format can do for you, review and understand the format, table optimization, and V-Order. [Delta Lake table optimization and V-Order](../../data-engineering/delta-optimization-and-v-order.md).
- Once the data is in OneLake, explore locally using [OneLake File Explorer](../../onelake/onelake-file-explorer.md). OneLake file explorer seamlessly integrates OneLake with Windows File Explorer. This application automatically syncs all OneLake items that you have access to in Windows File Explorer. You can also use any other tool compatible with ADLS Gen2 like [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/storage-explorer).

### Real-Time Intelligence APIs

**Fabric Real-Time Intelligence** is a comprehensive solution designed to support the entire lifecycle of real-time dataâ€”from ingestion and stream processing to analytics, visualization, and action. Built to handle high-throughput streaming data, it offers robust capabilities for data ingestion, transformation, querying, and storage, enabling organizations to make timely, data-driven decisions.

- **Eventstreams** enable you to bring real-time events from various sources and route them to various destinations, such as Lakehouses, KQL databases in Eventhouse, and Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../../real-time-intelligence/includes/fabric-activator.md)]. Learn more about [Eventstreams](../../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview.md) and [Eventstreams API](#develop-on-fabric).
- You can ingest streaming data in to Eventstreams via multiple protocols incl. Kafka, Event Hubs, AMQP, and a growing list of connectors listed [here.](../../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-manage-eventstream-sources.md)
- After processing the ingested events using either the no-code experience or using SQL operator (Preview), the result can be route to several Fabric destinations or to custom endpoints. Learn more about Eventstreams destinations [here.](../../real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-manage-eventstream-destinations.md)
- **Eventhouses** are designed for streaming data, compatible with Real-Time hub, and ideal for time-based events. Data is automatically indexed and partitioned based on ingestion time, giving you incredibly fast and complex analytic querying capabilities on high-granularity data that can be accessed in OneLake for use across Fabric's suite of experiences. Eventhouses support existing Eventhouse APIs and SDKs for direct interaction, allowing developers to read, write, and manage their data in Eventhouses. Learn more about [REST API](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/rest/index?context=/fabric/context/context-rti&pivots=fabric).
- If you're using Databricks or Jupyter Notebooks, you can utilize the Kusto Python Client Library to work with KQL databases in Fabric. Learn more about [Kusto Python SDK](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/python/kusto-python-client-library?context=/fabric/context/context-rti&pivots=fabric).
- You can utilize the existing [Microsoft Logic Apps](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/logicapps), [Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-explorer/data-factory-integration), or [Microsoft Power Automate](/azure/data-explorer/flow) connectors to interact with your Eventhouses or KQL Databases.
- [Database shortcuts in Real-Time Intelligence](../../real-time-intelligence/database-shortcut.md) are embedded references within an eventhouse to a source database. The source database can either be a KQL Database in Real-Time Intelligence or an Azure Data Explorer database. Shortcuts can be used for in place sharing of data within the same tenant or across tenants. Learn more about managing [database shortcuts using the API](#develop-on-fabric).

:::image type="content" source="media/partner-integration/multicloud-shortcuts.png" alt-text="Diagram showing multicloud shortcuts in OneLake." lightbox="media/partner-integration/multicloud-shortcuts.png":::

### Data sharing

Data Sharing allows Fabric users to share data across different Fabric tenants without duplicating it. This feature enhances collaboration by enabling data to be shared "in-place" from OneLake storage locations. The data is shared as read-only, accessible through various Fabric computation engines, including SQL, Spark, KQL, and semantic models. To use this feature, Fabric admins must enable it in both the sharing and receiving tenants. The process includes selecting data within the OneLake data hub or workspace, configuring sharing settings, and sending an invitation to the intended recipient.

:::image type="content" source="media/partner-integration/data-sharing.png" alt-text="Diagram showing how the data sharing process works in Fabric." lightbox="media/partner-integration/data-sharing.png":::

### Database mirroring

Mirroring in Fabric provides an easy experience to avoid complex ETL (Extract Transform Load) and integrate your existing data into OneLake with the rest of your data in Microsoft Fabric. You can continuously replicate your existing data directly into Fabric's OneLake. In Fabric, you can unlock powerful Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, Data Science, and data sharing scenarios. 
- Learn more about [mirroring and the supported databases](../../database/mirrored-database/overview.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/partner-integration/database-mirroring.png" alt-text="Diagram showing database mirroring in Fabric." lightbox="media/partner-integration/database-mirroring.png":::

Open mirroring enables **any application** to write change data directly into a mirrored database in Fabric. Open mirroring is designed to be extensible, customizable, and open. It's a powerful feature that extends mirroring in Fabric based on open Delta Lake table format. Once the data lands in OneLake in Fabric, open mirroring simplifies the handling of complex data changes, ensuring that all mirrored data is continuously up-to-date and ready for analysis.
