# What is Microsoft Fabric Git integration?

This article explains to developers how to integrate Git version control with the Microsoft Fabric Application lifecycle management (ALM) tool.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the items for Git integration are in preview. For more information, see the list of [supported items](#supported-items).

Git integration in Microsoft Fabric enables developers to integrate their development processes, tools, and best practices straight into the Fabric platform. It allows developers who are developing in Fabric to:

* Backup and version their work
* Revert to previous stages as needed
* Collaborate with others or work alone using Git branches
* Apply the capabilities of familiar source control tools to manage Fabric items

The integration with source control is on a workspace level. Developers can version items they develop within a workspace in a single process, with full visibility to all their items. The workspace structure, including [subfolders](./git-integration-process.md#folders), is preserved in the Git repository.

See the list of [supported items](#supported-items).

* Read up on basic [Git](/devops/develop/git/what-is-git) and [version control](/devops/develop/git/what-is-version-control) concepts.  

* Read more about the [Git integration process](./git-integration-process.md).

* Read about the best way to manage your [Git branches](./manage-branches.md).
