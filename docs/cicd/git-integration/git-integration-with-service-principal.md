# Azure DevOps - Git Integration with service principal (preview)

This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a service principal for integrating Microsoft Fabric with Azure DevOps. This integration allows you to automate CI/CD workflows, enabling you to manage your code and deployments more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

To register an application with your Microsoft Entra tenant and use it to integrate your Fabric workspace with Git, you need to have:

- At least [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator) permissions.
- A Fabric workspace with Admin permissions.

## Step 1: Register an application with Microsoft Entra ID

Register your application with Microsoft Entra ID, and create a secret by following the directions in [Register your app](/power-bi/developer/embedded/register-app#register-your-app).

## Step 2: Assign service principal to a DevOps organization

1. Log in to your Azure DevOps organization
1. Browse to **Organization settings -> User -> Add users**
1. Select to add the service principal  
1. Navigate to relevant Azure DevOps project settings -> Teams  
1. Add the service principal to relevant team

## Step 3: Create Azure DevOps source control connection

1. In [Fabric settings](../../fundamentals/fabric-settings.md), navigate to **Manage Connections and Gateways**. Select **+New** in the top right corner to add a new cloud connection.
1. Give it a name and set the **Type** to *Azure DevOps source control* using a *Service Principal* as the authentication method. Complete the other details (Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client secret) using the information you saved in [step 1](#step-1-register-an-application-with-microsoft-entra-id).

     You can also find the *Tenant Id* and *Client secret* in the Azure portal by navigating to the app in the Azure portal and selecting the **Overview** tab and **Manage -> Certificates and secrets** tabs respectively.

1. From your workspace settings, go to the *Git integration* tab, and select your newly created account. Complete the remaining information.

## Step 4: Allow calling Git REST APIs with service principal (optional)

### Share the Azure DevOps connection with service principal user

1. From Fabric settings, navigate to **Manage Connections and Gateways**
1. Select the connection you created in [Step 3](#step-3-create-azure-devops-source-control-connection), choose Manage Users 
1. Search for the service principal you create and select **Share**.

### Assign permissions to the service principal

1. Navigate to the relevant workspace.
1. Select **Manage Access -> Add People or Groups**
1. Search for the service principal and assign it a *contributor* role or higher. For more information on permissions, see the [Git integration permission table](./git-integration-process.md#required-fabric-permissions-for-popular-actions).

Now, you can [call Git REST APIs](./git-automation.md) with Service principal authentication.
