# Basic concepts in Git integration

This article explains basic Git concepts and the process of integrating Git with your Microsoft Fabric workspace.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

## Permissions

- In order to use Git integration, your organization's administrator must [enable it](../../admin/git-integration-admin-settings.md) by your organization's administrator.
- If the workspace and repo are in two different regions, the tenant admin must [enable cross-geo export](../../admin/git-integration-admin-settings.md#users-can-export-items-to-git-repositories-in-other-geographical-locations-preview).
- The actions you can take on a workspace depend on the [permissions](#azure-devops-permissions) you have in both the workspace and Azure DevOps.

### Azure DevOps permissions

The following list shows what different workspace roles can do depending on their Azure DevOps permissions:

- **Admin**: Can perform any operation on the workspace, limited only by their Azure DevOps role.
- **Member/Contributor**: Once they connect to a workspace, a member/contributor can commit and update changes, depending on their Azure DevOps role. For actions related to the workspace connection (for example, connect, disconnect, or switch branches) seek help from an Admin.
- **Viewer**: Can't perform any actions. The viewer can't see any Git related information in the workspace.

### Permissions needed for common operations

The following table describes the permissions needed to perform various common operations:

| **Operation**                                                        | **Workspace role**                                                                        | **Git permissions**                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|

## Connect and sync

Only a workspace admin can connect a workspace to Azure Repos, but once connected, anyone with permissions can work in the workspace. If you're not an admin, ask your admin for help with connecting.

When you [connect a workspace to Git](./git-get-started.md#connect-a-workspace-to-an-azure-repo), Fabric syncs between the two locations so they have the same content. During this initial sync, if either the workspace or Git branch is empty while the other has content, the content is copied from the nonempty location to the empty one.
If both the workspace and Git branch have content, you have to decide which direction the sync should go.

- If you commit your workspace to the Git branch, all supported workspace content is exported to Git and overwrites the current Git content.
- If you update the workspace with the Git content, the workspace content is overwritten, and you lose your workspace content. Since a Git branch can always be restored to a previous stage while a workspace can’t, if you choose this option, you're asked to confirm.

:::image type="content" source="./media/git-integration-process/git-sync-direction.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dialog asking which direction to sync if both Git and the workspace have content.":::

If you don’t select which content to sync, you can’t continue to work until you do so:

:::image type="content" source="./media/git-integration-process/sync-direction-continue.png" alt-text="Screenshot notification that you can't continue working until workspace is synced.":::

### Git status

After you connect, the workspace displays a *Git status* column that indicates the sync state of each item in the workspace in relation to the items in the remote branch.

:::image type="content" source="./media/git-integration-process/git-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot if items in a workspace with their Git status outlined.":::

Each item has one of the following statuses:

- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/synced-icon.png"::: Synced (the item is the same in the workspace and Git branch)
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/conflict-icon.png"::: Conflict (the item was changed in both the workspace and Git branch)
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/unsupported-icon.png"::: Unsupported item
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/uncommitted-icon.png"::: Uncommitted changes in the workspace
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/update-required-icon.png"::: Update required from Git
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/warning.png"::: Item is identical in both places but needs to be updated to the last commit

### Sync information

As long as you’re connected, the following information appears at the bottom of your screen:

- Connected branch
- Time of last sync
- Link to the last commit that the workspace is synced to

:::image type="content" source="./media/git-integration-process/sync-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sync information that appears on the bottom of the screen when connected to Git.":::

## Commits and updates

### Source control pane

On top of the screen is the Source control icon. It shows the number of items that are different in the workspace and Git branch. When the workspace is synced with the Git branch, the Source control icon displays a *0*.

:::image type="content" source="./media/git-integration-process/source-control-zero.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the source control icon showing zero items changed.":::

When changes are made either to the workspace or the Git branch, the source control icon shows the number of items that are different. Select the source control icon to open the Source control pane.

In the **Source control** pane, the **Changes** tab shows the number of items that were changed in the workspace and need to be committed to Git, and the **Updates** tab shows the number of items that were modified in the Git branch and need to be updated to the workspace.

In each tab, the changed items are listed with an icon indicating the status:

- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/new-icon.png"::: new
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/modified-icon.png"::: modified
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/deleted-icon.png" ::: deleted
- :::image type="icon" source="./media/git-integration-process/conflict-icon.png"::: conflict

:::image type="content" source="./media/git-integration-process/source-control-panel-items.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the source control panel showing the status of the changed items.":::

### Commit

- When there's more than one item to commit, you can select which items to commit to the Git branch.
- If there were updates made to the Git branch, commits are disabled until you update your workspace.

### Update

- Unlike *commit* and *undo*, the *Update* command always updates the entire branch and syncs to the most recent commit. You can’t select specific items to update.
- If changes were made in the workspace and in the Git branch *on the same item*, updates are disabled until the [conflict is resolved](./conflict-resolution.md).

Read more about how to [commit](./git-get-started.md#commit-changes-to-git) and [update](./git-get-started.md#update-workspace-from-git).
Read more about the update process and how to [resolve conflicts](./conflict-resolution.md).

## Considerations and limitations

### General limitations

- The Azure DevOps account must be registered to the same user that is using the Fabric workspace.
- The [authentication method](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage#authentication-methods-policy) in Power BI must be at least as strong as the authentication method for Azure DevOps. For example, if Azure DevOps requires multifactor authentication, Power BI needs to require multifactor authentication as well.
- Power BI Datasets connected to Analysis Services aren't supported at this time.
- Refreshing a semantic model using the [Enhanced refresh API](/power-bi/connect-data/asynchronous-refresh) causes a Git diff after each refresh.
- The workspace folder structure isn't reflected in the Git repository. Workspace items in folders are exported to the root directory.

## Workspace limitations

- Only the workspace admin can manage the connections to the [Azure Repo](/azure/devops/repos/get-started) such as connecting, disconnecting, or adding a branch.  
Once connected, anyone with [permission](#permissions) can work in the workspace.

### Branch and folder limitations

- Maximum length of branch name is 244 characters.
- Maximum length of full path for file names is 250 characters. Longer names fail.
- Maximum file size is 25 MB.
- You can’t download a report/dataset as *.pbix* from the service after deploying them with Git integration.
- If the item’s display name:

  - Has more than 256 characters
  - Ends with `.`’ or a space
  - Contains any of the following characters: `"`, `/`, `:`, `<`, `>`, `\\`, `*`, `?`, `|`

  The logical ID (Guid) is added as a prefix before the type, when naming the folder in Git.

### Sync and commit limitations

- The size limit for a commit is 125 MB.
- You can only sync in one direction at a time. You can’t commit and update at the same time.
- Sensitivity labels aren't supported and exporting items with sensitivity labels might be disabled. To commit items that have sensitivity labels without the sensitivity label, [ask your administrator](../../admin/git-integration-admin-settings.md#users-can-export-workspace-items-with-applied-sensitivity-labels-to-git-repositories-preview) for help.
- Works with [limited items](./intro-to-git-integration.md#supported-items). If unsupported items are in the folder, they're ignored.
- Duplicating names isn't allowed – even if Power BI allows it, the update, commit, or undo action fails.
- B2B isn’t supported.
- [Conflict resolution](./conflict-resolution.md) is partially done in Git.
