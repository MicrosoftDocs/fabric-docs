# Automate your deployment pipeline with Fabric APIs

The Microsoft Fabric [deployment pipelines](intro-to-deployment-pipelines.md) tool enables teams to build an efficient and reusable release process for their Fabric content.

Use the [deployment pipelines Fabric REST APIs](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines) to integrate Fabric into your organization's automation process. Here are a few examples of what can be done by using the APIs:

* Integrate Fabric into familiar DevOps tools such as Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

* Schedule pipeline deployments to happen automatically at a specific time.

* Deploy multiple pipelines at the same time.

* Cascade depending on pipeline deployments. If you have content connected across pipelines, you can make sure some pipelines are deployed before others.

## Prerequisites

To work with deployment pipeline APIs, you need the following prerequisites:

* The same [prerequisites you need to use deployment pipelines](./get-started-with-deployment-pipelines.md#prerequisites).
* A Microsoft Entra token for Fabric service. Use that token in the authorization header of the API call. For information about how to get a token, see [Fabric API quickstart](/rest/api/fabric/articles/get-started/fabric-api-quickstart).

You can use the REST APIs without PowerShell, but the scripts in this article use PowerShell. To run the scripts, you need to install the following programs:

* [PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
* [Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell)

## Deployment pipelines API functions

The [deployment pipelines Fabric REST APIs](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines) allow you to perform the following functions:

* [Get Deployment Pipeline](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/get-deployment-pipeline): Returns information about the specified deployment pipeline.
* [List Deployment Pipelines](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/list-deployment-pipelines): Returns a list of deployment pipelines that the user has access to.
* [List Deployment Pipeline Stages](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/list-deployment-pipeline-stages): Returns the stages of the specified deployment, including its ID, display name, description, and whether the stage is public or not.
* [List Deployment Pipeline Stage Items](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/list-deployment-pipeline-stage-items): Returns the supported items from the workspace assigned to the specified stage of the specified deployment pipeline.
* [Deploy Stage Content](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/deploy-stage-content): Deploys items from the specified stage of the specified deployment pipeline.

  * Use this API to deploy all items or to select specific items to deploy. If no specific items are selected, all items are deployed.
  * To find the relevant stage ID to deploy, use the [List Deployment Pipeline Stages](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/list-deployment-pipeline-stages) API.
  * This API is integrated with the [Long Running Operations APIs](/rest/api/fabric/core/long-running-operations) to monitor the deployment status.

    * Get the operation state to see if the operation is complete with the [Get Long Running  - Get Operation state](/rest/api/fabric/core/long-running-operations/get-operation-state) API.
    * For 24 hours after the deployment is completed, the extended deployment information is available in the[Get Operation Result](/rest/api/fabric/core/long-running-operations/get-operation-result) API.

* [Create deployment pipeline](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/create-deployment-pipeline): Create a Deployment Pipeline.
* [Delete deployment pipeline](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/delete-deployment-pipeline): Delete a Deployment Pipeline.
* [Update deployment pipeline](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/update-deployment-pipeline): Update a Deployment Pipeline.
* [Get deployment pipeline stage](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/get-deployment-pipeline-stage): Get details of a Deployment Pipeline Stage.
* [Update deployment pipeline stage](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/update-deployment-pipeline-stage): Update a Deployment Pipeline Stage.
* [Add deployment pipeline role assignment](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/add-deployment-pipeline-role-assignment): Add a role assignment to a deployment pipeline.
* [Delete deployment pipeline role assignment](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/delete-deployment-pipeline-role-assignment): Delete a role assignment from a deployment pipeline.
* [List deployment pipeline role assignments](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/list-deployment-pipeline-role-assignments): List all role assignments for a deployment pipeline.
* [Assign workspace to deployment pipeline stage](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/assign-workspace-to-stage): Assign a workspace to a specific deployment pipeline stage.
* [Unassign workspace from deployment pipeline stage](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/unassign-workspace-from-stage): Unassign a workspace from a specific deployment pipeline stage.
* [Get deployment pipeline operation](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/get-deployment-pipeline-operation): Get details of a deployment pipeline operation.
* [List deployment pipeline operations](/rest/api/fabric/core/deployment-pipelines/list-deployment-pipeline-operations): List all operations for a deployment pipeline.

You can also use other [Fabric REST API](/rest/api/fabric/) calls, to complete related operations.

## PowerShell examples

You can use the following PowerShell scripts to understand how to perform several automation processes. To view or copy the text in a PowerShell sample, use the links in this section.

You can also download the entire [`Fabric-Samples`](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/features-samples/fabric-apis/DeploymentPipelines-AssignToNewDeploymentPipelineAndDeploy.ps1) GitHub folder.

* [Deploy all](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/features-samples/fabric-apis/DeploymentPipelines-DeployAll.ps1)

  Provide the following information:

  * Pipeline name
  * Source stage name
  * Target stage name
  * Deployment notes (optional)
  * Principal type. Choose either *UserPrincipal* or *ServicePrincipal*. If service principal, also provide:
    * Application (client) ID of the service principal
    * Directory (tenant) ID of the service principal
    * Secret value of the service principal

* [Selective deploy](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/features-samples/fabric-apis/DeploymentPipelines-SelectiveDeploy.ps1)

  Provide the following information:

  * Pipeline name
  * Source stage name
  * Target stage name
  * Items to deploy (items display name and item type)
  * Deployment notes (optional)
  * Principal type. Choose either *UserPrincipal* or *ServicePrincipal*. If service principal, also provide:
    * Application (client) ID of the service principal
    * Directory (tenant) ID of the service principal
    * Secret value of the service principal

* [Assign to new deployment pipeline and deploy](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/features-samples/fabric-apis/DeploymentPipelines-AssignToNewDeploymentPipelineAndDeploy.ps1)

  Provide the following information:

  * Development workspace ID
  * New production workspace name
  * Pipeline name
  * Deployment notes (optional)
  * Principal type. Choose either *UserPrincipal* or *ServicePrincipal*. If service principal, also provide:
    * Application (client) ID of the service principal
    * Directory (tenant) ID of the service principal
    * Secret value of the service principal

## Considerations and limitations

When using the deployment pipelines APIs, consider the following limitations:

* All limitations that apply for deployment pipeline, apply when using the APIs. For more information, see [Deployment pipelines best practices](./understand-the-deployment-process.md#considerations-and-limitations).
* *Dataflows* are currently not supported. Customers using dataflows can use the [Power BI APIs](./pipeline-automation.md).
* Not all deployment options available in the Power BI APIs are available in Fabric. The following APIs *aren't* available in Fabric's Deploy stage content API:

  * allowPurgeData
  * allowTakeOver
  * allowSkipTilesWithMissingPrerequisites

  To use one of these APIs, use the [Power BI API](./pipeline-automation.md) to deploy. However, these APIs only work for Power BI items.
