## Power BI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you access Power BI on a web browser version older than Chrome 94, Microsoft Edge 94, Safari 16.4, Firefox 93, or equivalent, you need to upgrade your web browser to a newer version by August 31, 2024. Using an outdated browser version after this date can prevent you from accessing features in Power BI.

Updates to Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service are summarized at [What's new in Power BI?](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-latest-update?tabs=powerbi-service)
