## Data use of Copilot for SQL databases

In database, Copilot can only access the database schema that is accessible in the user's database.

By default, Copilot has access to the following data types:

- Previous messages sent to and replies from Copilot for that user in that session.
- Contents of SQL query that the user has executed.
- Error messages of a SQL query that the user has executed (if applicable).
- Schemas of the database.

## Tips for working with Copilot for SQL databases

- Copilot is best equipped to handle SQL database topics, so limit your questions to this area.

- Be explicit about the data you want Copilot to examine. If you describe the data asset, with descriptive table and column names, Copilot is more likely to retrieve relevant data and generate useful outputs.
