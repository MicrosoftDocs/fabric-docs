# Reassign a workspace to a different capacity

When you create a workspace, it's assigned to a [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity). The capacity that new workspaces are assigned to by default is determined by the capacity type and/or by the configuration of Fabric or capacity administrators. After you create a workspace, you can reassign it to a different capacity, if any are available, and if you have sufficient permissions to do so. You [reassign workspaces](#reassign-a-workspace-to-a-different-capacity) to different capacities using workspace license modes.

## License modes and capacity types

The workspace license modes refer to different capacity types. There are two types of license modes: per user license modes and capacity license modes.

**Per user license mode**: With a per user license mode, a workspace is hosted on system reserved capacity. The options are *Pro* and *Premium Per User (PPU)*.

**Capacity license mode**: With a capacity license mode, a workspace is hosted on a capacity which either has been purchased or is a trial, and is reserved for the organization. These capacities are divided into stock keeping units (SKUs). Each SKU provides a different number of capacity units (CUs), which are used to calculate the capacity's compute power.

The capacity license mode options are related to several [capacity types](../admin/capacity-settings.md?tabs=power-bi-premium#view-your-capacity):

* **Premium capacity**: Premium capacity refers to a capacity that was bought as part of a Power BI Premium subscription. These capacities use P SKUs.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Premium capacities are transitioning to Fabric. For more information, see [Power BI Premium transition to Microsoft Fabric](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-faq#power-bi-premium-transition-to-microsoft-fabric).

* **Embedded**: Embedded refers to capacity that was bought as part of a Power BI Embedded subscription. These capacities use A or EM SKUs.

* **Trial**: Refers to a Microsoft Fabric trial capacity. These capacities use Trial SKUs.

* **Fabric capacity**: Fabric capacity refers to  Microsoft Fabric capacity. These capacities use F SKUs.

## Reassign a workspace to a different capacity

You can reassign a workspace to a different capacity via workspace license modes in the workspace settings.

1. Open the workspace settings and choose **License info**. Information about the current license is displayed.

1. Select **Edit**. The list of available licenses modes appears.

1. Select the desired license mode and specify the capacity the workspace will be hosted on.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can choose specific capacities only when you select one of the capacity license modes. Fabric automatically reserves shared capacity for per-user licenses.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The types of items contained in the workspace can affect the ability to change license modes and/or move the workspace to a capacity in a different region. See [Moving data around](../admin/portal-workspaces.md#moving-data-around) for detail.
