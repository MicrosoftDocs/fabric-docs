# Direct Lake in web modeling (preview)

**Open data model**, or web modeling, works with semantic models with Direct Lake tables. Direct Lake tables can be **Direct Lake on SQL** or **Direct Lake on OneLake**, which have different considerations when creating and editing in the web.

| Scenario | Direct Lake on OneLake | Direct Lake on SQL |
|:-----------|:------------|:  ------------|
| Creating in the web       | <ul><li>Select **Create** in the left navigation, then **OneLake catalog**.</li><li>Select **New semantic model** from Lakehouse.</li> <li>Select **OneLake catalog** from web modeling.</li> <li>Select **New item** from a workspace and choosing **Semantic model**, then **OneLake catalog**</li></ul>    | Select **New semantic model** from SQL analytics endpoints or Warehouses.       |
| Editing in the web       | Select **Open data model** from the semantic model details page or context menu.    | Select **Open data model** from the semantic model details page or context menu.    |

**Edit in Desktop** is available when web modeling to continue [live editing any Direct Lake semantic model in Power BI Desktop](direct-lake-power-bi-desktop.md). 

## Create a semantic model with Direct Lake tables

To create a semantic model with **Direct Lake on OneLake tables**, take the following steps.

1. Select **Create** from the left navigation bar, then select **OneLake catalog** and choose a Fabric item. Alternatively, open the Lakehouse and select **New semantic model**.
2.	Give your semantic model a name, pick a Fabric workspace for it, and select the tables to include. Then press **OK**.
   
The semantic model is created and now you're live editing the modeling in the browser.

To create a semantic model with **Direct Lake on SQL tables**, take the following steps.

1.	Open the SQL analytics endpoint or warehouse, go to **Reporting** and then select **New semantic model**.
2.	Give your semantic model a name, pick a Fabric workspace for it, and select the tables to include. Then press **OK**.
   
The semantic model is created and now you're live editing the modeling in the browser.

> [!NOTE]
> Check your pop-up blocker if web modeling doesn’t appear after clicking OK.

The differences between Direct Lake on OneLake and Direct Lake on SQL are explained in the [Overview](direct-lake-overview.md).

## Edit a semantic model in Direct Lake mode

To edit a semantic model with Direct Lake tables later, take the following steps.

1.	Navigate to the semantic model in the Fabric Portal. **Home**, **OneLake catalog**, and **search** at the top of the page are available to help you find it.
2.	Select the semantic model to open the details page, or use the context-menu, then select **Open data model**.

Now you're live editing the semantic model in the web. The model opens by default in **viewing mode** to avoid accidental edits. Change to **editing mode** in the top right-hand corner of the window. **Edit in Desktop** is also available to change to [live edit in Power BI Desktop](direct-lake-power-bi-desktop.md).

## Composite semantic models with Direct Lake and import storage mode tables

A composite semantic model has tables in different storage modes. Direct Lake on OneLake table storage mode already could mix tables from other Fabric data sources, such as lakehouses, warehouses, SQL databases in Fabric, and mirrored databases. And with this update, now that flexibility is extended much further with the ability to add in import tables from any data source, from 100s of connectors in Power Query online. 

Import tables can be added an existing semantic model with Direct Lake on OneLake tables. Edit the semantic model in Power BI web modeling and choose **Get data** or **Transform data** from the ribbon.

> [!Note]
> If you haven’t set up a credential for this data source before you may be prompted to do that in the Power Query online experience. After that, if the load data fails on saving the transformations, go to the schedule refresh page of the semantic model and set the credentials there as well before returning to web modeling and refreshing.

Direct Lake on OneLake tables can be added to an existing semantic model with import storage mode tables too. Edit the semantic model in Power BI web modeling and choose **OneLake catalog** from the ribbon.
