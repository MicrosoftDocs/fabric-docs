# Direct Lake in web modeling (preview)

**Open data model**, or web modeling, works with semantic models with Direct Lake tables. Direct Lake tables can be **Direct Lake on SQL** or **Direct Lake on OneLake**, which have different considerations when creating and editing in the web.

| Scenario | Direct Lake on OneLake | Direct Lake on SQL |
|:-----------|:------------|:  ------------|
| Creating in the web       | Not yet available       | Select **New semantic model** from Lakehouse, SQL analytics endpoints, or Warehouses.       |
| Editing in the web       | Select **Open data model** from the semantic model details page or context menu. There are some limitations during public preview | Select **Open data model** from the semantic model details page or context menu.        |

**Edit in Desktop** is available when web modeling to continue [live editing any Direct Lake semantic model in Power BI Desktop](direct-lake-power-bi-desktop.md). 

## Create a semantic model in Direct Lake mode

To create a semantic model with Direct Lake on SQL tables, take the following steps.

1.	Open the Lakehouse and select **New semantic model**. For SQL analytics endpoint or warehouse, go to **Reporting** and then select **New semantic model**.
2.	Give your semantic model a name, pick a Fabric workspace for it, and select the tables to include. Then press **OK**.
   
The semantic model is created and now you are live editing the modeling in the browser.

> [!NOTE]
> Check your pop-up blocker if web modeling doesnâ€™t appear after clicking OK.

Semantic models with Direct Lake tables created in the web  use Direct Lake on SQL storage mode. The differences between Direct Lake on OneLake and Direct Lake on SQL are explained in the [Overview](direct-lake-overview.md).

## Edit a semantic model in Direct Lake mode

To edit a semantic model with Direct Lake tables later, take the following steps.

1.	Navigate to the semantic model in the Fabric Portal. **Home**, **Onelake catalog**, and **search** at the top of the page are available to help you find it.
2.	Select the semantic model to open the details page, or use the context-menu, then select **Open data model**.

Now you are live editing the semantic model in the web. The model opens by default in **viewing mode** to avoid accidental edits. Change to **editing mode** in the top right-hand corner of the window. **Edit in Desktop** is also available to change to [live edit in Power BI Desktop](direct-lake-power-bi-desktop.md).
