# Give users access to workspaces

After you [create a workspace](create-workspaces.md) in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], or if you have an Admin or Member role in a workspace, you can give others access to it by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. For an explanation of the different roles, see [Roles in workspaces](roles-workspaces.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) on Power BI items for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] Pro users who browse content in a workspace, assign them the Viewer role.
>
> After you add or remove workspace access for a user or a group, the permission change only takes effect the next time the user logs into [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

## Give access to your workspace

1. Because you have the Admin or Member role in the workspace, on the command bar of the workspace page, you see **Manage access**. Sometimes this entry is in the **More options (...)** menu.

1. Enter name or email, select a [role](roles-workspaces.md), and select **Add**. You can add security groups, mail-enabled security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers. If you have the member role, you can only add others to the member, contributor, or viewer roles.

1. You can view and modify access later if needed. Use the **Search** box to search for people or groups who already have access to this workspace. To modify access, select the dropdown arrow and select a role.
