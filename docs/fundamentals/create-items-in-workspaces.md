2. You can see all items are categorized by tasks. Each task represents daily job-to-be-done when you build a data solution: get data, store data, prepare data, analyze and train data, track data, visualize data, and develop data. Inside each category, item types are sorted alphabetically. You can scroll down and up to browse all item types which are available for you to create.
