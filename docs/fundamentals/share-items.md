# Share items in Microsoft Fabric

Workspaces are the central places where you collaborate with your colleagues in Microsoft Fabric. Besides assigning workspace roles, you can also use item sharing to grant and manage item-level permissions in scenarios where:

- You want to collaborate with colleagues who don't have a role in the workspace.
- You want to grant additional item level-permissions for colleagues who already have a role in the workspace.

This document describes how to share an item and manage its permissions.

## Share an item via link

1. In the list of items, or in an open item, select the **Share** button :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/share-items/share-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of share button.":::.

1. The **Create and send link** dialog opens. Select **People in your organization can view**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/create-send-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create and send link.":::

1. The **Select permissions** dialog opens. Choose the audience for the link you're going to share.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/select-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select permission.":::

    You have the following options:

    * **People in your organization** This type of link allows people in your organization to access this item. It doesn't work for external users or guest users. Use this link type when:

        * You want to share with someone in your organization.
        * You're comfortable with the link being shared with other people in your organization.
        * You want to ensure that the link doesn't work for external or guest users.

    * **People with existing access** This type of link generates a URL to the item, but it doesn't grant any access to the item. Use this link type if you just want to send a link to somebody who already has access.

    * **Specific people** This type of link allows specific people or groups to access the report. If you select this option, enter the names or email addresses of the people you wish to share with. This link type also lets you share to guest users in your organization's Microsoft Entra ID. You can't share to external users who aren't guests in your organization.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your admin has disabled shareable links to **People in your organization**, you can only copy and share links using the **People with existing access** and **Specific people** options.

1. Choose the permissions you want to grant via the link.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/additional-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of additional permissions.":::

    Links that give access to **People in your organization** or **Specific people** always include at least read access. However, you can also specify if you want the link to include additional permissions as well.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > The **Additional permissions** settings vary for different items. Learn more about the [item permission model](#item-permission-model).
    >
    > Links for **People with existing access** don't have additional permission settings because these links don't give access to the item.

    Select **Apply**.

1. In the **Create and send link** dialog, you have the option to copy the sharing link, generate an email with the link, or share it via Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/create-send-link-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of showing link sharing options.":::

    * **Copy link**: This option automatically generates a shareable link. Select **Copy** in the **Copy link** dialog that appears to copy the link to your clipboard.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/copy-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of copy link.":::

    * **by Email**: This option opens the default email client app on your computer and creates an email draft with the link in it.

    * **by Teams**: This option opens Teams and creates a new Teams draft message with the link in it.

1. You can also choose to send the link directly to **Specific people** or groups (distribution groups or security groups). Enter their name or email address, optionally type a message, and select **Send**. An email with the link is sent to your specified recipients.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/directly-send-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of directly send link.":::

    When your recipients receive the email, they can access the report through the shareable link.

## Manage item links

1. To manage links that give access to the item, in the upper right of the sharing dialog, select the **Manage permissions** icon:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/manage-permission-entry-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entry of manage permission pane.":::

1. The **Manage permissions** pane opens, where you can copy or modify existing links or grant users direct access. To modify a given link, select **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/manage-permission-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of manage permission pane.":::

1. In the **Edit link** pane, you can modify the permissions included in the link, people who can use this link, or delete the link. Select **Apply** after your modification.

    This image shows the **Edit link** pane when the selected audience is **People in your organization can view and share**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/edit-link-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of edit org link.":::

    This image shows the **Edit link** pane when the selected audience is **Specific people can view and share**. Note that the pane enables you to modify who can use the link.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/edit-link-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of edit specific link.":::

1. For more access management capabilities, select the **Advanced** option in the footer of the Manage permissions pane. On the management page that opens, you can:

    - View, manage, and create links.
    - View and manage who has direct access and grant people direct access.
    - Apply filters or search for specific links or people.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/permission-management-page-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of permission management page." lightbox="./media/share-items/permission-management-page-1.png":::

## Grant and manage access directly

In some cases, you need to grant permission directly instead of sharing link, such as granting permission to service account, for example. 

1. Select **Manage permission** from the context menu.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/permission-management-entry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of permission management entry.":::

1. Select **Direct access**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/select-direct-access-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting direct access tab." lightbox="./media/share-items/select-direct-access-tab.png":::

1. Select **Add user**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/add-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add user." lightbox="./media/share-items/add-user.png":::

1. Enter the names of people or accounts that you need to grant access to directly. Select the permissions that you want to grant. You can also optionally notify recipients by email. 

1. Select **Grant**.
   
    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/direct-share-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of direct share dialog.":::

1. You can see all the people, groups, and accounts with access in the list on the permission management page. You can also see their workspace roles, permissions, and so on. By selecting the context menu, you can modify or remove the permissions.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/modify-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of modify access." lightbox="./media/share-items/modify-access.png":::

    > [!NOTE] 
    > You can't modify or remove permissions that are inherited from a workspace role in the permission management page. Learn more about [workspace roles](./roles-workspaces.md) and the [item permission model](#item-permission-model).

## Item permission model

Depending on the item being shared, you may find a different set of permissions that you can grant to recipients when you share. Read permission is always granted during sharing, so the recipient can discover the shared item in the OneSource data hub and open it.

|Permission granted while sharing|Effect|
|--- | --- |
|Read|Recipient can discover the item in the data hub and open it. Connect to the Warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint of the Lakehouse.|
|Edit|Recipient can edit the item or its content.|
|Share|Recipient can share the item and grant permissions up to the permissions that they have. For example, if the original recipient has *Share*, *Edit*, and *Read* permissions, they can at most grant *Share*, *Edit*, and *Read* permissions to the next recipient.|
|Read All with SQL analytics endpoint|Read data from the SQL analytics endpoint of the Lakehouse or Warehouse data through TDS endpoints.|
|Read all with Apache Spark|Read Lakehouse or Data warehouse data through OneLake APIs and Spark. Read Lakehouse data through Lakehouse explorer.|
|Subscribe to OneLake events| Subscribe to OneLake events for lakehouses, data warehouses, mirrored databases, SQL databases, and KQL databases.|
|Build|Build new content on the semantic model.|
|Execute|Execute or cancel execution of the item.|

## Considerations and limitations

* When a user's permission on an item is revoked through the manage permissions experience, it can take up to two hours for the change to take effect if the user is signed-in. If the user is not signed in, their permissions will be evaluated the next time they sign in, and any changes will only take effect at that time.

* The **Shared with me** option in the **Browse** pane currently only displays Power BI items that have been shared with you. It doesn't show you non-Power BI Fabric items that have been shared with you.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/share-items/shared-with-me.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Shared with me option in Browse pane.":::

* The sharing dialog for lakehouses, data warehouses, mirrored databases, and SQL databases shows an option to subscribe to OneLake events. Permission to subscribe to OneLake events is granted along with the *Read All* Apache Spark permission. This is a temporary limitation.
