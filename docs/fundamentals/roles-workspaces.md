# Roles in workspaces in Microsoft Fabric

Workspace roles let you manage who can do what in a [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] workspace. [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] workspaces sit on top of OneLake and divide the data lake into separate containers that can be secured independently. Workspace roles in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] extend the Power BI workspace roles by associating new [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] capabilities such as data integration and data exploration with existing workspace roles. For more information on Power BI roles, see [Roles in workspaces in Power BI](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-new-workspaces).

You can either assign roles to individuals or to security groups, Microsoft 365 groups, and distribution lists. To grant access to a workspace, assign those user groups or individuals to one of the workspace roles: Admin, Member, Contributor, or Viewer. Here's how to [give users access to workspaces](give-access-workspaces.md).

To create a new workspace, see [Create a workspace](create-workspaces.md).

Everyone in a user group gets the role that you assign. If someone is in several user groups, they get the highest level of permission that's provided by the roles that they're assigned. If you nest user groups and assign a role to a group, all the contained users have permissions.

Users in workspace roles have the following [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] capabilities, in addition to the existing Power BI capabilities associated with these roles.

<sup>1</sup> Contributors and Viewers can also share items in a workspace, if they have Reshare permissions.

<sup>2</sup> Other permissions are needed to read data from shortcut destination. Learn more about [shortcut security model.](../onelake/onelake-shortcuts.md?#types-of-shortcuts)

<sup>3</sup> Other permissions are needed to perform certain operations on data in an Eventhouse. Learn more about the [hybrid role-based access control model](/kusto/access-control/role-based-access-control?view=microsoft-fabric&preserve-view=true).

<sup>4</sup> Keep in mind that you also need permissions on the gateway. Those permissions are managed elsewhere, independent of workspace roles and permissions.
