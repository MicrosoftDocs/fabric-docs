# Global search

When you're new to [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], you have only a few items (workspaces, reports, apps, lakehouses). But as you begin creating and sharing items, you can end up with long lists of content. That's when searching, filtering, and sorting become helpful.

## Search for content

At the top of Home, the global search box finds items by title, name, or [tag](/fabric/governance/tags-overview). Sometimes, the fastest way to find an item is to search for it. For example, if a dashboard you didn't use in a while isn't showing up on your Home canvas. Or, if your colleague shared something with you, but you don't remember what it's named or what type of content they shared. Sometimes, you might have so much content that it's easier to search for it rather than scrolling or sorting.

Search is available from Home and also most other areas of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]. Just look for the search box or search icon. :::image type="icon" source="./media/fabric-search/fabric-search-icon.png":::

In the **Search** field, type all or part of the name of an item, creator, tag, or workspace. You can even enter your colleague's name to search for content that they shared with you. The search finds matches in all the items that you own or have access to.

In addition to the **Search** field, most experiences on the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] canvas also include a **Filter by keyword** field.  Similar to search, use **Filter by keyword** to narrow down the content on your canvas to find what you need. The keywords you enter in the **Filter by keyword** pane apply to the current view only. For example, if you open **Browse** and enter a keyword in the **Filter by keyword** pane, [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] searches only the content that appears on the **Browse** canvas.

## Sort content lists

If you have only a few items, sorting isn't necessary. But when you have long lists of items, sorting helps you find what you need. For example, this **Shared with me** content list has many items.

:::image type="content" source="./media/fabric-search/fabric-shared-with-me-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Shared with me content list with multiple items.":::

Right now, this content list is sorted alphabetical by name, from Z to A. To change the sort criteria, select the arrow to the right of **Name**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/fabric-search/power-bi-sort-z-to-a-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a content list being sorted by the Name column.":::

Sorting is also available in other areas of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]. In this example, the workspaces are sorted by the **Refreshed** date. To set sorting criteria for workspaces, select a column header, and then select again to change the sorting direction.

:::image type="content" source="./media/fabric-search/fabric-refresh.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a content list sorted by the Refreshed date column.":::

Not all columns can be sorted. Hover over the column headings to discover which can be sorted.

## Filter content lists

Another way to locate content quickly is to use the content list **Filter**. Display the filters by selecting **Filter** from the upper right corner. The filters available depend on your location in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]. This example is from a **Recent** content list. It allows you to filter the list by content **Type**, **Time**, or **Owner**.

## Considerations and limitations

The Fabric global search uses [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search), and as a result, it isn't available in regions where Azure AI Search isn't supported. For a list of regions where Azure AI Search is supported, see [Azure AI Search regions list](/azure/search/search-region-support).
