## Data use of Copilot in Fabric in Data Warehouse

In warehouse, Copilot can only access the database schema that is accessible in the user's warehouse.

By default, Copilot has access to the following data types:

- Previous messages sent to and replies from Copilot for that user in that session.
- Contents of SQL query that the user has executed.
- Error messages of a SQL query that the user has executed (if applicable).
- Schemas of the warehouse.
- Schemas from attached warehouses or SQL analytics endpoints when cross-DB querying.

## Tips for working with Copilot in Fabric in Data Warehouse

- Copilot is best equipped to handle data warehousing topics, so limit your questions to this area.
- Be explicit about the data you want Copilot to examine. If you describe the data asset, with descriptive table and column names, Copilot is more likely to retrieve relevant data and generate useful outputs.
