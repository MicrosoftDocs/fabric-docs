# Visualize your workspace monitoring in a Real-Time dashboard or Power BI report using Sample Templates

Fabric workspace monitoring provides rich telemetry across your workspace assets, including Eventhouses, Power BI Semantic Models, Data Engineering (GraphQL), and Mirrored Databases. The workspace monitoring data is stored in an Eventhouse, which is part of Fabric Real-Time Intelligence. This telemetry includes diagnostic logs, ingestion results, query activity, and system metrics, all of which are collected and organized in a secure, read-only Eventhouse database.
To help you turn this data into actionable insights, this article guides you through connecting your monitoring data to a Real-Time Dashboard or a Power BI report using a sample end-to-end monitoring solution.

To get started, follow the [end-to-end sample guide](../real-time-intelligence/sample-end-to-end.md) to set up the sample environment. Once complete, follow the steps in this article to learn how to connect your own monitoring data and visualize it in real time.

## Prerequisites

* A Power BI Premium capacity or a [workspace](create-workspaces.md) with Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity).
* [Workspace monitoring](enable-workspace-monitoring.md) must be enabled in your workspace.
* A monitoring sample workspace with the [End-to-End Real-Time Intelligence sample solution](../real-time-intelligence/sample-end-to-end.md) setup.

## Connect the sample Real-Time Dashboard

To connect the sample Real-Time dashboard to monitoring data from another workspace:

1. Open the folder containing the autogenerated items from the sample end-to-end solution and navigate to the **Real-Time dashboard**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Real-Time dashboard autogenerated from the samples solution.":::
1. Open the sample dashboard and switch to **Editing mode**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/editing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the editing switch.":::
1. Go to **Manage** > **Data Sources**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/manage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage switch page.":::
1. Select **Add** in the **Data Sources** side pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/add-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add data option.":::
1. Select the KQL Database from the Monitoring Eventhouse in the workspace you want to connect to.
1. After you add the data source, change the display name to reflect the workspace the Monitoring database belongs to.
1. Finally, select **Save** to apply the changes.
1. Use the **Workspace** parameter to switch between Eventhouses and monitor multiple workspaces from a single dashboard.

## Connect the sample Power BI Report

To connect the sample Power BI report to monitoring data from another workspace:

1. Open the folder containing the autogenerated items from the sample end-to-end solution and navigate to the **Semantic model** report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/pbi/semantic-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Semantic model report autogenerated from the samples solution.":::

1. Select the ellipsis (...) next to the report name and navigate to the **Settings** option.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/pbi/settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dropdown menu.":::

1. Under the **Parameters** section:
    1. Replace the **Query URI** with your Monitoring Eventhouse URI from the workspace you want to connect to.

        :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/pbi/query-uri.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Query URI field in the parameters settings.":::

        * Find the Monitoring Eventhouse URI by navigating to the Eventhouse's **System Overview** page, and locating the **Query URI** in the **Eventhouse Details** side pane.

            :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/system-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Query URI field in the System overview page.":::

    1. Replace the **Database ID** with your Monitoring Eventhouse's database ID.

        :::image type="content" source="media/sample-gallery-workspace-monitoring/pbi/database-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Database ID field in the parameters settings.":::

        * Find the database ID by navigating to the Monitoring KQL Database page in the Monitoring Eventhouse and locating the database ID in the page URL, after the `/databases/` segment.
    1. Select **Apply** to save the changes. You might be prompted to sign in and validate your credentials.

1. Navigate back to the autogenerated items list and refresh the Semantic model.
